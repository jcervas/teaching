# Key Terms and Definitions

## Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) Model

- A model for understanding public opinion that is based on four axioms. This model posits that people receive information, decide whether to accept it, and then sample from these accepted considerations when forming an opinion.

## Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) Model Axioms

1. **Reception Axiom**: The greater a person's level of cognitive engagement with an issue, the more likely he or she is to be exposed to and comprehend - in a word, to receive - political messages concerning that issue.
   - The likelihood of an individual receiving a particular piece of information is affected by their level of political awareness.
  
3. **Resistance Axiom**: People tend to resist arguments that are inconsistent with their political predispositions, but they do so only to the extent that they possess the contextual information necessary to perceive a relationship between the message and their predispositions.
   - Individuals are more likely to resist information that conflicts with their existing beliefs and opinions.

5. **Accessibility Axiom**: The more recently a consideration has been called to mind or thought about, the less time it takes to retrieve that consideration or related considerations from memory and bring them to the top of the head for use.

7. **Response Axiom**: Individuals answer survey questions by averaging across the considerations that are immediately salient or accessible to them.
   - An individual's response to a question about a policy or issue depends on the mix of positive and negative considerations available in their mind at the moment of inquiry.

## Key terms and defintions

- **Public Opinion**: The collective attitudes or beliefs of the public about a given subject, particularly in the context of politics and policy issues.

- **True Attitude Model**: A conventional model that assumes people have a single, unchanging 'true attitude' toward an issue, which is problematic according to the RAS Model.

- **On-line Model**: A theoretical model that assumes people continuously update their attitudes based on new information. Criticized for being unrealistic in how people actually process and update attitudes.

- **Information Flows**: Streams of messages, arguments, or cues that individuals are exposed to from their environment, especially in the context of political information.

- **Sampling Axiom**: One of the four axioms in the RAS Model, stating that people sample from available considerations to form an opinion at the moment of inquiry.

- **Considerations**: Information, beliefs, or opinions that people hold, from which they 'sample' when forming an attitude or answering a survey question.

- **Situational Variables**: Variables that can affect which 'considerations' are most salient or relevant at a given moment when an individual is forming an opinion.

- **Opinion Statement**: The expression of an individual's genuine opinion at the moment of answering a survey question, according to the RAS Model.

- **Political Environment**: The overarching setting or climate in which political information is disseminated and in which political attitudes are formed.

- **Political Awareness**: The degree to which an individual is informed about and engaged with political issues and information.

- **Political Predispositions**: An individual's pre-existing attitudes, beliefs, or values that influence how they receive and interpret new political information. it refers to an alteration in long-term response probabilities brought about by the acquisition of new considerations.
- **Attitude Change**: It involves the process by which new considerations are added to the pool of existing considerations in a person's mind, permanently altering long-term response probabilities on the issue.
   - Within the RAS (Reception-Acceptance-Similarity) model, attitudes, in the conventional sense of the term, do not exist. Instead, people make "attitude reports" or "survey responses" based on momentarily salient considerations. Attitude change, within this model, is not understood as a conversion experience but as a change in the balance of positive and negative considerations related to a given issue. In the RAS model, permanent alterations in long-term response probabilities are the equivalent of attitude change.

## Deductions from Model (Chapter 4)

1. **Deduction D1:** Shifting balance of liberal and conservative communications leads to systematic attitude change.

2. **Deduction D2:** Response instability consists almost exclusively of chance variation around a largely stable central tendency.

3. **Deduction D3:** Ambivalence contributes to fluctuations in attitudes and considerations.

4. **Deduction D4:** When the flow of communications remains steady, response instability consists of chance variation around a stable central tendency.

5. **Deduction D5:** Better-informed individuals are more likely to reject communications inconsistent with their values.

6. **Deduction D6:** More politically aware individuals tend to form more homogeneous considerations, contributing to greater response stability.

7. **Deduction D7:** More politically aware individuals exhibit less random instability in their attitude reports.

8. **Deduction D8:** Attitude stability can be stronger for issues with clear partisan divisions, as they provide clearer message cues.

9. **Deduction D9:** Attitude statements on certain issues are more reliable, suggesting high salience and frequent discussion.

10. **Deduction D10:** The relationship between issue importance and response variability may vary, with some evidence supporting it.

11. **Deduction D11:** In a stable informational environment, individuals tend to remain near their equilibrium points, resulting in minimal susceptibility to systematic attitude change.

12. **Deduction D12:** There is some evidence that changes in open-ended remarks are associated with changes in closed-ended responses.

13. **Deduction D13:** Internal conflict occurring across interviews contributes to response instability.


# Chapter 2: Information, predispositions, and opinion

## Introduction
- The chapter aims to delve into the mechanics of how opinions are shaped, with particular focus on attitudes. This introduction sets the stage by acknowledging the complex ways in which attitudes are molded and changed over time. It stresses the importance of understanding these mechanisms, given that attitudes are central to a host of human behaviors, including politics.

---

## Attitudes as Considerations
- This section challenges the simplistic notion that attitudes are fixed or rigid. It introduces the concept that attitudes are made up of various "considerations." These considerations are like different variables that contribute to the overall formation of an attitude. The text speaks of how even people who share demographics or political affiliations can show considerable variation in their attitudes.

    ### Sampling Error
    - This subsection introduces the idea of "sampling error" to explain why people who are exposed to the same set of information might still hold varying opinions. Sampling errors occur when the individuals form their opinions based on different subsets of the total available information or "considerations." This creates a source of variability in public opinion even when the public is exposed to the same information.

---

## Political Awareness
- The role of political awareness is examined, suggesting that people who are more politically aware are likely to have attitudes that are more stable over time. However, these individuals are also more susceptible to attitude change when presented with new information, particularly if it is framed in a way that resonates with their pre-existing beliefs or "considerations."

    ### Political Values
    - The text discusses the importance of underlying political values, suggesting that they act as a sort of lens through which new information is viewed. For instance, someone with strong environmental values may be more likely to absorb and agree with new information that confirms the importance of climate change action.

---

## Schema Theory
- The section introduces the concept of "schema," borrowed from cognitive psychology. A schema is a mental framework that organizes past experiences and guides the interpretation of new information. For example, if someone is introduced as a "forty-year-old professor," different qualities would be noticed compared to if the same person was introduced as a "forty-year-old mother of three."

    ### Multiple Schemas
    - Here, the text delves into the idea that individuals have multiple schemas for understanding a given subject or concept. These multiple schemas can influence what qualities are noticed and how new information is interpreted. Different schemas can also result in varying attitudes toward the same subject, depending on which schema is activated at a given moment.

---

## Decision-Making Processes
- This part of the chapter tackles the convoluted process of decision-making, covering factors like perception, memory efficiency, and motivation. Despite the complexity, a single piece of information can dramatically affect an individual's opinion.

    ### Top-of-the-Head Decisions
    - The text discusses the tendency for many individuals to make quick decisions based on readily accessible information or considerations. This idea is termed as "top-of-the-head" decisions, which often occur because life is too short and the human mind too fallible to consider all available information.

    ### Comprehensive Decisions
    - In contrast, the text also speaks of comprehensive decisions that involve a wider range of considerations. This method is more deliberative and may involve weighing numerous "likes" and "dislikes" about a subject before reaching a conclusion.

---

## Summary
- The chapter wraps up by reiterating the complex interplay among various levels of information, attention to this information, and individual political values. It introduces a model based on these ideas, which will be detailed in the next chapter, that seeks to explain how the "considerations" available to individuals influence their responses to survey questions and decisions in general.


# Chapter 3: How citizens acquire information and convert it into public opinion

## Introduction

- Introduces the Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) Model as an alternative to existing models of public opinion.
- Argues that traditional models are insufficient to explain the complexity and dynamism of public opinion.

### The Problem with Existing Models

- Criticizes existing models for assuming a static, unchanging 'true attitude' in individuals.
- Discusses the limitations of the "conventional 'true attitude' model" and the "on-line model" for explaining public opinion.

### The Four Axioms

- Introduces the four axioms of the RAS Model but does not go into detail.
  
## Information Flows and the Sampling Axiom

- Discusses the significance of information flows in shaping public opinion.
- Focuses on the 'Sampling Axiom,' which posits that people sample from available considerations to form an opinion at the moment of inquiry.

### The Crux of the Argument

- Highlights the importance of situational variables and considerations in forming an opinion.
- Argues that individuals may sample different considerations based on the issue at hand, making public opinion dynamic rather than static.

### Challenges to the Sampling Axiom

- Addresses objections to the Sampling Axiom, noting it is a generalization but one that holds in most cases.
  
## The RAS Model and Other Theories

- Compares the RAS Model to other prevalent theories like the 'on-line model.'
- Criticizes the 'on-line model' for being unrealistic in its expectations of how people process political information.

### Why the On-line Model Falls Short

- Argues that the on-line model is impractical because it expects people to update a range of attitudes based on each piece of new information.
- States that the on-line model is simply a restatement of the conventional "true attitude" model, which has been shown to be inadequate.

### Terminology: From "True Attitudes" to "Opinion Statements"

- Introduces the term 'Opinion Statement' as a more accurate descriptor than 'true attitudes' for what the model proposes.
  
## How the Model is Used in This Book

- Explains how the four axioms will be used throughout the book to explore various aspects of mass opinion in different political environments.

### Methodology of the Book

- Outlines the methodological approach, which involves deducing implications from the four axioms and testing them empirically.
  
### Preview of the Argument

- Provides a preview of how the RAS Model will be used to explain changes in public opinion based on various factors like political awareness and changes in information flow.

# Chapter 4: Coming to terms with response instability

### Supporting Evidence

1. **Statistical Significance**: The statistical data in Table 4.6 reveal that although there is some consistency, it does not meet the theoretical expectations.
   
2. **Coding Errors**: Lack of coder agreement in 10-15% of all open-ended remarks introduces a significant margin of error.

3. **Directionally Uncodable Remarks**: Items with higher rates of such remarks correlate with a greater shortfall from theoretical expectations.

4. **Internal vs. Cross-Interview Conflict**: The analysis suggests that respondents are often unaware of their internal conflicts, which are more likely to arise across multiple interviews than within a single one.

5. **Regression Coefficients**: These are used to summarize relationships between stability and consistency, revealing that items with lower percentages of uncodable remarks have stronger consistency-stability relationships.

### Implications

1. **RAS Model vs. Measurement Error Tradition**: The RAS model asserts that the inconsistency is not just noise but represents genuine ambivalence, contrasting with traditional models that attribute inconsistencies to measurement error.

2. **Broader Impact**: The study informs various aspects like the priming effect of the mass media, the effects of survey question order, and attitude change.

### Conclusions

- The observed inconsistencies in Table 4.6 are likely as accurate as can be expected, given the various constraints like measurement errors and sample size.
- The findings support the RAS model's argument about the prevalence of ambivalence in public opinion.

# Chapter 7

This is a comprehensive analysis focusing on attitude change within the context of political awareness, and it deals with numerous factors that contribute to attitude change, including the role of persuasive messages, awareness levels, resistance to change based on existing beliefs, and the dynamics of individual and mass attitudes. The text also examines case studies, such as U.S. defense spending and involvement in Central America, to validate the proposed models.

1. Attitude change involves two steps: reception of persuasive messages and acceptance or nonacceptance of their contents.

2. The reception of persuasive messages depends on an individual's political awareness level, with higher awareness increasing the likelihood of comprehending change-inducing messages.

3. Politically aware individuals are more adept at resisting persuasive communications that contradict their core values. The extent of this resistance is influenced by the ideological distance between the individual and the message.

4. The impact of awareness on resistance to change is influenced by the intensity of the persuasive message and the novelty of the addressed issue.

5. Further investigation is needed to explore the effects of messages with varying intensities and the role of considerations in the change process.

6. The model assumes a simplified one-sided information flow, which may not capture the complexities of real-world situations, particularly in cases like U.S. involvement in Central America or defense spending.
