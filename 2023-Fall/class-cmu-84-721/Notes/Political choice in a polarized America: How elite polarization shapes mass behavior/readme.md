# Summary: Introduction to "Political choice in a polarized America: How elite polarization shapes mass behavior"

## Summary

The introduction chapter of the book "Political choice in a polarized America: How elite polarization shapes mass behavior" sets the framework for understanding how elite polarization in American politics affects mass behavior. The central aim is to explore two key questions: First, how do individual policy orientations (stances on policy issues) influence one's partisanship (loyalty to a political party) and vote choice (selection of a candidate or party)? Second, how has this relationship evolved under the impact of increasing ideological division among political elites, referred to as "elite polarization"?

## Objectives

The introduction sets the stage for an in-depth exploration of how elite polarization influences mass political behavior in America. It aims to answer two core questions:

1. How do policy orientations shape partisanship and vote choice?
2. How has the relationship between these variables evolved under the influence of elite polarization?

## Key Terms

- **Elite Polarization**: Increasing ideological division between political elites.
- **Policy Orientations**: Individual stances on policy issues.
- **Partisanship**: Loyalty to a particular political party.
- **Vote Choice**: The act of voting for a specific candidate or party.

## Research Design

### Panel Data

The author uses panel data, a longitudinal dataset, to assess the impact of policy orientations on partisanship within individuals over time. This type of data is critical for determining if policy orientations are a key driver for changes in individual political alignment.

### Cross-Sectional Time Series Data

The author also employs cross-sectional time series data to analyze how the relationships between partisanship, policy orientations, elite polarization, and vote choice have evolved across the broader electorate.

## Theoretical Claims

### Importance of Policy Orientations

The author argues that policy orientations are a critical political disposition. According to the author, individuals often align their partisanship to match their policy orientations.

### Role of Elite Polarization

The author expects elite polarization to amplify the effects of policy orientations on vote choices. However, this only holds true if individual policy orientations are stable over time, as indicated by the panel data.

## Data Sources

### Individual-Level Data

- **American National Election Study (ANES)**: A comprehensive dataset that focuses on political attitudes.
- **General Social Survey (GSS)**: A broader dataset that is collected annually and includes a variety of topics, not just political issues.

### Elite-Level Data

- **NOMINATE Data**: Provides ideological scores for legislators based on roll-call votes.
- **Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) Rankings**: Ranks legislators based on key votes.

## Methodological and Theoretical Contributions

The author's approach is novel in that it integrates both individual and elite-level factors to provide a comprehensive understanding of political choice. This enables a nuanced interpretation of how policy orientations and partisanship interact within varying contextual environments defined by elite polarization.

## Conclusion

The introduction establishes the theoretical and methodological framework for exploring how elite polarization has shaped mass behavior in the American political landscape. It argues that understanding the influence of policy orientations and partisanship, and how they interact within a polarized context, is key to unlocking the complexities of political behavior.

## Longer Summary

The introduction chapter of the book "Political choice in a polarized America: How elite polarization shapes mass behavior" sets the framework for understanding how elite polarization in American politics affects mass behavior. The central aim is to explore two key questions: First, how do individual policy orientations (stances on policy issues) influence one's partisanship (loyalty to a political party) and vote choice (selection of a candidate or party)? Second, how has this relationship evolved under the impact of increasing ideological division among political elites, referred to as "elite polarization"?

To answer these questions, the author employs two types of data: panel data and cross-sectional time series data. Panel data, or longitudinal data, are used to track the same individuals over time to see if their partisanship adjusts to match their policy orientations. This is pivotal for confirming the author's claim that policy orientations are a significant factor driving change within individuals. Cross-sectional time series data, on the other hand, provide a snapshot of the electorate at multiple time points and are employed to assess broader trends and relationships among policy orientations, partisanship, and vote choice over time.

The author's main theoretical assertion is that policy orientations are not just mere political preferences; they serve as a key political disposition that significantly influences an individual's party alignment. Moreover, the author posits that elite polarization magnifies the effect of policy orientations on political choice. However, this theory only holds if individual policy orientations remain stable over time, a proposition tested using panel data.

The data for the research is sourced from two main surveys: the American National Election Study (ANES) and the General Social Survey (GSS). ANES is focused strictly on political attitudes, whereas the GSS covers a broader range of topics and is administered annually. The author also uses elite-level data, including NOMINATE scores that rank legislators based on roll-call votes, and Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) rankings to measure partisan and ideological polarization among political elites.

The book's approach is innovative in that it combines individual and elite-level data to understand political choice comprehensively. It aims to show that both policy orientations and partisanship are crucial in shaping political behavior, but their significance is also dictated by the broader contextual environment, which is influenced by elite polarization.

In summary, the introduction serves as a blueprint for the rest of the book, outlining the theoretical framework, methodological approaches, and data sources. It makes a strong case for the need to study both individual behavior and elite polarization to fully grasp the complexities of political choice in a polarized American landscape.
