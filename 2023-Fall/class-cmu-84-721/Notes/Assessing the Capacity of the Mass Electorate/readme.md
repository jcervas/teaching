## Summary of "_Assessing the Capacity of Mass Electorates_"

Converse, Philip E. 2000. “Assessing the Capacity of Mass Electorates.” Annual Review of Political Science 3(1): 331–353. https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.331 (Accessed October 18, 2022).


### Introduction
The article explores the complexities and challenges associated with understanding voter behavior in democracies. It discusses the disconnect between the ideals of democratic practices and the practical realities of an electorate that is often uninformed or poorly informed.

### Collective Wisdom vs. Individual Limitations
The article points out that even though individual voters may not fully understand policies or political platforms, the "collective wisdom" of the electorate often leads to sensible outcomes. This idea provides some comfort in the efficacy of democratic systems.

### The Evolution of Research on Voter Behavior
The article reviews various methods and approaches for studying voter behavior, borrowing from fields like psychology, political science, and economics. It also critiques the limitations and biases inherent in these traditional research methods.

### Understanding the Public's Issue Positions
The article goes into detail about the difficulty in obtaining stable and meaningful responses from the general public on policy issues. It suggests that the instability is not solely due to vague or poorly worded questions. This complexity is partly because people from different information strata interpret questions differently, making it hard to gauge public opinion accurately.

### New Departures in Research
The article wraps up by introducing new avenues for research aimed at gaining a better understanding of electoral capacity. These include:

- **New Issue Measurement**: This involves the use of differently formatted questions that may better resonate with the electorate's real-world concerns.
  
- **Simulation of “Higher-Quality” Electorates**: These are sophisticated simulations designed to project the preferences of a more informed electorate.
  
- **Deliberative Polling**: These are field experiments where a national sample of the electorate is exposed to expert opinions and arguments on various policy issues and then deliberates over them.

The article notes that while these new methods show promise, they also have limitations like high cost and complexity.
