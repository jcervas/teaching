# Course Description

This course explores why Americans are so politically divided, how those
divisions create and reinforce inequalities, and what we can do to
address them. We look at key issues like voting rights, healthcare
access, racial and economic disparities, ethical uses of AI, and
environmental justice. Through guided discussions and debates, you will
build critical thinking, public speaking, and empathy skills. If you are
interested in political science, law, or social justice, this class will
give you a clear understanding of today’s U.S. political landscape and
ideas for promoting fairness and equity at every level of society.

# Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1.  **Explain** the historical and structural factors that contribute to
    political polarization in the United States.
2.  **Describe** how political divisions intersect with and reinforce
    racial, economic, and social inequalities.
3.  **Analyze** key policy issues (e.g., voting rights, healthcare,
    environmental justice) through the lens of fairness and equity.
4.  **Evaluate** different perspectives on contentious political issues
    with empathy and critical reasoning.
5.  **Apply** principles of ethical reasoning to assess the social
    impacts of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.
6.  **Demonstrate** improved skills in public speaking, structured
    debate, and respectful civic discourse.
7.  **Synthesize** information from political science, law, and social
    justice frameworks to form evidence-based arguments.
8.  **Reflect** on their own values, biases, and roles as civic
    participants in a divided society.

# Grading

Your grade depends heavily on active engagement. This course is
interactive: your preparation (completing the readings), contributions
to discussions, and participation in debates are essential to your
success.

*Attendance & Participation* Regular attendance and active involvement
form a significant part of your final grade (see grading section). To
recognize that occasional absences are sometimes unavoidable (e.g., for
religious observance, job interviews, university-sanctioned events, or
illness), you are allowed two excused absences without penalty. If you
must miss class, please notify me at least 24 hours in advance (unless
it’s an emergency or sudden illness) so we can arrange a way for you to
catch up.[^4]

*Assignments & Deadlines* You are expected to meet all assignment
deadlines. If you anticipate being unable to turn something in on time,
contact me before the due date to discuss alternatives. Late work will
incur a small penalty[^5] provided it does not impede your classmates’
progress (for instance, in group projects). Failing to participate or
contribute meaningfully, especially in ways that affect others’ work,
will result in a lower grade.

# Assessment

The course grade will be a weighted average of the following components:

# Student Privacy in Class Discussions

This course will challenge you to think deeply about difficult and
potentially provocative questions. You should be prepared to encounter
material that may be unsettling or even offensive. If you’re not
comfortable with the possibility of being offended, you might want to
reconsider enrolling. However, if you choose to participate and find
yourself disagreeing with something said by a classmate, or me, or with
content from the readings, I encourage you to engage in thoughtful
debate and present your own perspective. Simply disliking a viewpoint
doesn’t invalidate it. My hope is that, regardless of how strongly we
disagree or how passionately we advocate for our beliefs, we will always
maintain respect and treat each other with dignity as we share and
defend our ideas.

In this course, we value the open exchange of ideas and respect the
privacy of all students. To create a safe and supportive learning
environment, the following guidelines regarding student privacy in class
discussions will be strictly observed:

1.  **Confidentiality**: Any personal information, opinions, or
    experiences shared by students during class discussions, whether
    in-person or online, are to be treated as confidential. Students are
    prohibited from sharing or discussing this information outside of
    class without explicit permission from the individuals involved.

2.  **Respectful Communication**: Students are encouraged to express
    their thoughts and ideas freely while remaining respectful of
    others’ privacy. Avoid sharing details about other students’
    contributions, identities, or personal circumstances outside the
    classroom setting.

3.  **Recording and Sharing**: Recording of class discussions, whether
    audio, video, or text-based, is strictly prohibited. Anyone caught
    making an unauthorized recording will automatically fail the
    course—regardless of any accommodations they may have been granted.

4.  **Online Discussions**: For online forums and discussions, similar
    privacy standards apply. Students should be mindful of the public or
    semi-public nature of online platforms and refrain from sharing
    sensitive or personally identifiable information.

5.  **Consequences for Breach of Privacy**: Violations of this privacy
    policy may result in disciplinary action, which could include
    removal from the course, a formal reprimand, or other consequences
    as determined by the university’s code of conduct.

6.  **Principle of Charity**: When engaging in discussions, apply the
    principle of charity. This means interpreting others’ arguments in
    the most reasonable and positive way before criticizing them. Assume
    that others are making sincere attempts to contribute meaningfully,
    and engage with their strongest points, not just the easiest to
    refute.

7.  **Space for Additional Context**: Acknowledge that opinions shared
    in discussions may be based on limited information or experiences.
    If a classmate’s perspective seems unclear or incomplete, allow them
    the opportunity to provide additional context. Encourage questions
    that seek to understand rather than dismiss others’ views.

By participating in this course, you agree to uphold these privacy
standards and contribute to a respectful, inclusive, and secure learning
environment for all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Course Principles

Throughout this course, we will engage with several key themes that
intersect and build upon one another to deepen our understanding of the
complex social and political landscape in the United States.

1.  **Analyzing a Range of Perspectives and Political Divides**  
    One of our primary themes is exploring how different communities’
    experiences shape political divides. We will critically examine how
    underrepresented voices—those with distinct histories, challenges,
    and worldviews—contribute to a growing political polarization.
    Understanding these varied experiences is essential for grasping the
    roots of political conflict and for developing strategies that
    bridge divides.

2.  **The Significance of Varied Viewpoints in Justice and Injustice**  
    We will delve into why recognizing and valuing multiple perspectives
    is crucial for identifying instances of injustice that might
    otherwise be overlooked. By centering viewpoints from communities
    whose experiences differ from the majority, we gain insight into how
    justice is perceived, enacted, and sometimes denied. This work will
    guide us toward more equitable approaches to social and political
    challenges.

3.  **The Role of Systems and Institutions in Perpetuating
    Inequality**  
    Another critical theme is examining how U.S. institutions and
    systems have historically reinforced privilege and power imbalances.
    We will analyze how laws, policies, and institutional practices
    shape access to resources, opportunities, and rights—often
    disadvantaging certain groups. By understanding these systemic
    forces, we can begin to address the root causes of injustice.

4.  **Ethical Obligations to Address Inequality**  
    Throughout the semester, we will reflect on our individual and
    collective responsibility to confront inequalities. This includes
    considering how we can uplift underrepresented voices, advocate for
    fair policies, and work against oppressive structures. These
    reflections will encourage us to think critically about our roles in
    society and the impact of our actions on the broader pursuit of
    justice.

> *These themes will be woven into our discussions, readings, and
> assignments. By the end of the semester, you will have developed a
> nuanced perspective on how identity, power, and politics intersect—and
> you’ll be equipped to contribute to meaningful change in your
> communities.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Representation Statement

I am committed to including a broad range of perspectives in the
readings and materials for this course. If you believe a critical voice
is missing, please let me know so I can improve the syllabus now and in
future offerings.

**We must treat every individual with respect.** We come from many
different backgrounds, and this variety of viewpoints is fundamental to
building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community.
“Representation” can refer to the ways we identify ourselves—race,
color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual
orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran
status, or genetic information, among others. Each of these identities
shapes the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to
campus. Promoting these varied viewpoints not only fuels excellence and
innovation but also advances the pursuit of justice. We acknowledge our
imperfections while fully committing to the work—inside and outside our
classrooms—of building and sustaining a campus community that embraces
these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive
environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether
intentional or unintentional. They contribute to an unwelcoming
atmosphere for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the
university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or
hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and
seek support—either in the moment or afterward. You can share your
experiences using the following resources:

- **Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion**  
  Email: **<csdi@andrew.cmu.edu>**  
  Phone: (412) 268-2150

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a documented disability and an accommodations letter from
the Office of Disability Resources, please discuss your needs with me as
early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that
accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect you may have
a disability and are not yet registered with the Office of Disability
Resources, you can contact them at **<access@andrew.cmu.edu>**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Student Well-Being

The past few years have been challenging. We are all under significant
stress and uncertainty. I encourage you to find ways to move regularly,
eat well, and reach out to your support system—or to me at
**<cervas@cmu.edu>**—if you need help. We can all benefit from support
during stressful times, and this semester is no exception.

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that interfere
with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety,
substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, or lack of
motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events can
diminish your academic performance and reduce your ability to
participate in daily activities. CMU offers services that can help, and
treatment does work. Learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at:

- **Counseling and Psychological Services**:
  <http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/>  
  Phone (24/7): 412-268-2922

Please remember that support is always available—don’t hesitate to reach
out.

## Eberly Center

Students,

This semester, I am working with the Eberly Center on educational
research. Because of this, I have included a statement about the
research and your rights as a research participant in your syllabus.
That same statement along with common questions can be found below in
this email.

Please reach out to Laura Pottmeyer <lpottmey@andrew.cmu.edu> with any
questions about the study.

Best,

Jonathan

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Research to Improve the Course**

For this class, the Eberly Center is working with your instructor on
educational research. This research will involve your coursework. You
will not be asked to do anything above and beyond the normal learning
activities and assignments that are part of this course. You are free
not to participate in this research, and your participation will have no
influence on your grade for this course or your academic career at CMU.
If you do not wish to participate or if you are under 18 years of age,
please send an email to Laura Pottmeyer (<lpottmey@andrew.cmu.edu>), and
then your data will not be included. Participants will not receive any
compensation. The data collected as part of this research will include
student grades. All analyses of data from participants’ coursework will
be conducted after the course is over and final grades are submitted. In
the future, once we have removed all identifiable information from your
data, we may use the data for our future research studies, or we may
distribute the data to other researchers for their research studies. The
Eberly Center will conduct the data analysis and interpretation of the
results for this research project. The Eberly Center for Teaching
Excellence & Educational Innovation is located on the CMU-Pittsburgh
Campus and its mission is to support the professional development of all
CMU instructors regarding teaching and learning. To minimize the risk of
breach of confidentiality, the Eberly Center will never have access to
data from this course containing your personal identifiers. All data
will be analyzed in de-identified form and presented in the aggregate,
without any personal identifiers. If you have questions pertaining to
your rights as a research participant, or to report concerns to this
study, please contact Laura Pottmeyer (<lpottmey@andrew.cmu.edu>).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Plain language interpretation**:

- After the semester is over, the data generated by students in this
  course, which often comes from things like assignments, projects,
  surveys, etc., is stripped of all identifying information and
  aggregated into a larger research dataset for analysis.
- As a potential participant in this research, you have a say in what
  happens to your data. If you are OK with data generated by you in this
  course being de-identified and aggregated into a larger research
  dataset, then there is nothing you need to do - simply proceed through
  the course as you would with any other course.
- IF you would NOT like your data to be used for that purpose (or you
  are under 18) that is when you email Laura Pottmeyer and say “Hi
  Laura, this is my name and course number, I would like to opt-out,
  thanks, goodbye”, and your data will not be included in the research
  analyses.
- This opt-out process is confidential, and your instructors will not
  know whether you have opted out or not.
- Importantly, your decision in this matter will NOT affect your
  experience in the course. You are only making a decision about what
  happens to your data AFTER the course is over.

Below are some potential questions students may have…

| **QUESTION**                                                               | **ANSWER**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| What do I need to do?                                                      | If you would like to opt out of your data being used in research analyses, all you need to do is email Laura Pottmeyer (email is in the syllabus) with your name, course number, and say “I’d like to opt out”. **If you do not wish to opt out, you do not need to do anything**. |
| What is this research about?                                               | Unfortunately, we cannot provide further details at this time. If, after the course is over, you are curious about this kind of work, please feel free to contact Laura Pottmeyer or anyone else at the Eberly Center (<lpottmey@andrew.cmu.edu>).                                 |
| Do I have to make up my mind right now?                                    | No, there is no need to make up your mind right now. You can choose to opt out anytime, even if it is on the last day of the semester.                                                                                                                                             |
| What if I don’t want to participate?                                       | If you’d like to opt out, the only thing that will change is what happens to your data AFTER the course is over. **Your required coursework will be the same regardless of your decision**.                                                                                        |
| Can I see the results?                                                     | Often the results from this kind of work do not come together right away. If you are curious about the results after this course is over, please feel free to contact Laura Pottmeyer, and we would be happy to give you an update, if possible.                                   |
| How will the data be used?                                                 | In two ways: to help improve the course and to contribute to educational research on how students learn best. Note that all analyses occur after course grades are submitted and student identifiers are removed.                                                                  |
| If I opt out, do I still have to complete work assigned by the instructor? | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
