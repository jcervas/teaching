## Worksheet 4: Safe Spaces, Trigger Warnings, and Microaggressions

### Scenario: The Dorm Debate at Valley University
At **Valley University**, the **Student Senate** passed a resolution requiring professors to include **trigger warnings** for “potentially offensive or traumatic material.” The policy also allowed students to designate certain classrooms as **“safe spaces”** where debates over identity, religion, or politics would not take place. Finally, it created a reporting system for **microaggressions**, where repeated phrases like “Where are you really from?” or “You speak English so well” could result in disciplinary review.

Supporters praised the resolution. Senior *Maya Patel* said:  
> “These measures finally give marginalized students a chance to learn without constant anxiety. No one should have to defend their identity every time they walk into class.”  

Opponents were alarmed. Professor *Henry Dawson* of political science warned:  
> “Who decides what counts as a microaggression? Professors will avoid hard topics altogether. Students need challenge, not protection from ideas.”  

The university president addressed the campus:  
> “We want a respectful community, but we must also preserve academic freedom. I am not convinced this policy achieves both.”  

### Group Roles
- **Groups 1 & 2 (Pro-Safe Space):** Argue these measures are necessary to protect vulnerable students and foster learning.  
- **Groups 3 & 4 (Pro-Free Expression):** Argue the policy restricts academic freedom and will discourage open debate.
