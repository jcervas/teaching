## Worksheet 1: Should Hate Speech Be Prohibited on Campuses?

### Scenario: Flyers at Midland State
At **Midland State University**, tension erupted when anonymous flyers began appearing across campus. One flyer taped to the student union door read, *“Keep Midland pure — outsiders don’t belong here.”* Another left on library tables declared, *“Real students don’t hide behind diversity quotas.”* No one knows who put them up, but dozens were found across residence halls, academic buildings, and even the campus daycare center.

The **Black Student Alliance** held a press conference, where President Tasha Reynolds said:  
> “This isn’t debate. This is telling us we don’t belong here. Students are skipping class out of fear that the next flyer will name them personally.”  

Others disagreed. Junior political science major Marcus Lee told the campus paper:  
> “Admissions policies *are* controversial. Calling this hate speech just shuts down debate. If you can’t talk about race and fairness in admissions at a university, where can you?”  

The university president emailed the community, saying Midland was reviewing whether to adopt a **ban on ‘demeaning and hateful expression.’** He added:  
> “We must weigh our responsibility to student well-being against our obligation to protect free inquiry.”  

### Group Roles
- **Groups 1 & 2 (Pro-Regulation):** Argue that Midland *should* prohibit hate speech to ensure students feel safe and able to learn.  
- **Groups 3 & 4 (Anti-Regulation):** Argue that banning “demeaning expression” is too vague, risks censorship, and undermines free speech.
