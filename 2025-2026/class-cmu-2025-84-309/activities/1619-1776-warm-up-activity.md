# Warm-Up Activity: Keyword Brainstorm

Before we dive into today’s readings, let’s explore some key ideas that will shape our discussion.

## Step 1: Group Work
Your group will brainstorm words, phrases, or images that come to mind for each of the following keywords.  
Write down as many associations as you can—these could be synonyms, related concepts, historical references, or even images that pop into your head.  

| **Keyword**  | **Associations / Synonyms / Images** |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Founding     |                                       |
| Slavery      |                                       |
| Democracy    |                                       |
| Freedom      |                                       |

## Step 2: Compare & Connect
- Share your brainstorm with the class.  
- Notice where your associations **overlap** with other groups and where they **diverge**.

## Step 3: Reflect
As you listen to other groups, consider:  

- Which words carried the most positive or negative associations?  
- Which words seemed to create the most disagreement or difference in interpretation?  
- What might these differences reveal about how people interpret the American past?

## Additional Discussion Questions

- Should the official U.S. policy be to focus on the idealism of the founding, or on the flaws that coincided with the ideals?    
- How does the way we tell America’s founding story shape debates about race, politics, and identity today?
