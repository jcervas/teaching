- "Build the Wall"  
- "Defund the Police"

3. What role should safety concerns play in regulating political expression?  
4. What’s the fairest policy moving forward?

3. College Republicans President: Claims censorship of conservative views is rampant.

**Guiding Questions** 

1. Should universities be able to ban controversial rallies in the name of safety?  
2. How does hindsight affect how we judge these decisions?  
3. What lessons does this history hold for today’s debates about harmful speech?  
4. If you were on the university’s board in 1963, how would you decide for each rally?

Free speech advocates say this is excessive.

Explain your reasoning.
