## Worksheet 2: Harassment vs. Free Expression

### Scenario: A Biology Paper at Riverside
In a **Riverside University** biology seminar, sophomore *Ethan Tran* submitted a final paper arguing that “some groups may be naturally less suited for scientific work.” Ethan cited controversial studies and wrote, *“Acknowledging these differences may help us assign resources more effectively.”*

Several classmates said the paper was more than academic speculation. *Lena Morales*, one of only two Latina women in the class, emailed the dean:  
> “This wasn’t abstract theory. It was Ethan saying people like me don’t belong in science. I couldn’t go back to lab after reading it.”  

The professor defended grading the paper:  
> “Academic freedom means letting students pursue uncomfortable lines of inquiry. We don’t have to agree with the conclusions, but inquiry itself must be protected.”  

The administration opened an investigation, debating whether the paper was protected as academic speech or whether it constituted **harassment** by creating a hostile learning environment. Faculty are divided: some call it intellectual exploration, others say it crosses into discrimination.

### Group Roles
- **Groups 1 & 2 (Broad Harassment):** Argue the paper crossed the line into harassment and harmed classmates’ ability to learn.  
- **Groups 3 & 4 (Narrow Harassment):** Argue the paper is protected inquiry; punishing it would chill free thought and debate.
