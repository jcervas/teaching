## Worksheet 3: Protest and Disruption

### Scenario: The Speaker at Lakeshore
The student government at **Lakeshore College** invited *Daniel Shore*, a columnist known for criticizing affirmative action, to deliver a talk titled *“Merit or Identity?”* Anticipation was high: supporters saw it as a chance for serious debate, while opponents viewed it as an endorsement of racism.

As soon as Shore began, about 40 students stood and chanted: *“Shame! Shame! Your words are violence!”* Others banged on chairs and whistled. After 15 minutes of disruption, Shore left the stage without completing his talk.  

Supporters of the protest argued:  
> “We exercised our free speech to reject harmful ideas. Stopping him was the only way to protect our community.”  

Critics countered:  
> “This was silencing. Students who wanted to hear him were denied the chance. That isn’t protest — it’s censorship.”  

Now the administration must decide: Was the disruption a legitimate protest, or a violation of free speech principles?

### Group Roles
- **Groups 1 & 2 (Pro-Disruption):** Argue the protest was justified resistance against harmful speech.  
- **Groups 3 & 4 (Anti-Disruption):** Argue the protest denied free speech to others and undermined the college’s mission.
