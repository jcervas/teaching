# 🔑 Warm-Up Activity: Keyword Brainstorm

Before we dive into today’s readings, let’s explore some key ideas that will shape our discussion.  

---

## Step 1: Group Work  
Your group will brainstorm words, phrases, or images that come to mind for each of the following keywords.  
Write down as many associations as you can—these could be synonyms, related concepts, historical references, or even images that pop into your head.  

| **Keyword**  | **Associations / Synonyms / Images** |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| Founding     |                                       |
| Slavery      |                                       |
| Democracy    |                                       |
| Freedom      |                                       |

## Step 2: Compare & Connect  
- Share your brainstorm with the class.  
- Notice where your associations **overlap** with other groups and where they **diverge**.

## Step 3: Reflect  
As you listen to other groups, consider:  

- Which words carried the most positive or negative associations?  
- Which words seemed to create the most disagreement or difference in interpretation?  
- What might these differences reveal about how people interpret the American past?

## 🎯 Purpose  
This activity will help us foreground key themes in the upcoming readings.  
The **1619 Project** and the **1776 Report** offer sharply different interpretations of America’s founding.  
By unpacking these keywords first, you’ll be ready to see how each text uses—or contests—these ideas.
