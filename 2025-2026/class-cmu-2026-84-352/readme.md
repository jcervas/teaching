## Course Information

Democracy in the United States is looking a bit rickety. A notable portion of the American populace, often long before any ballots are cast, holds a persistent belief that the electoral process is flawed or ‘rigged’. This sentiment is exacerbated by instances where the majority’s preferences seem to be ignored or sidelined. In recent years, there have been notable shifts in the judiciary, with long-established legal precedents being overturned, often contrary to widespread public opinion. Additionally, the progress achieved in the realm of voting rights since the 1960s is facing setbacks in numerous states. A particularly alarming indication of the vulnerability of our democratic institutions occurred five years ago with the then (and now)-president’s unconstitutional attempts to maintain power, culminating in a violent insurrection against the U.S. government. 

This course will provide an in-depth exploration of the essential aspects of representation and voting rights, concentrating on ensuring election integrity, achieving fair redistricting, and promoting a just democracy. We will examine the historical trajectory of voting rights in the U.S., confront contemporary challenges to our democratic processes, and consider a range of reforms to strengthen democratic representation in our society. Additionally, we will discuss how political polarization is impacting even non-political institutions. An example of this is the recent campaign against the former president of Harvard, who was both the university’s first Black president and second female president. Her academic background in political science, with a focus overlapping this course’s content, adds relevance to this discussion.

The course is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of these issues, encouraging critical analysis and informed debate about the state and future of democracy in the United States. The course will combine lectures with interactive discussions, case studies, guest speakers, and project-based learning. Students will engage in critical analysis of current events, participate in simulations, and conduct research projects to propose solutions for enhancing democratic representation.

# Course Plan

Throughout this course, we will delve into the multifaceted concept of representation, focusing on three key areas: 1) the intricacies of voting rights, 2) the dynamics of electoral democracy and representation, and 3) the technicalities of formal representation, particularly redistricting. While the primary lens of our study will be the American political system, the universality of democracy and representation means that we may also draw valuable insights from other global systems. Our exploration will begin with an in-depth look at the theoretical foundations of representation, framed within the context of democratic norms and the legal and constitutional frameworks that define U.S. institutions. A significant portion of the course will be dedicated to a historical review of voting rights in America, tracing their evolution and current state. A crucial aspect of legislative elections in the U.S. is their organization in single-member districts, necessitating the redrawing of district boundaries every ten years. We will allocate several weeks to thoroughly understand this redistricting process. This will not only include learning how to create legally compliant electoral maps but also exploring the potential for and implications of manipulated districting, which can yield partisan or racial advantages. Additionally, we will develop the skills to identify and assess features in redistricting plans that may indicate such biases.

## Course Components and Grading

**Missing and Late Assignments**

This course proceeds according to a strict progression from topic to topic, which ensures fairness, consistency, and a shared baseline of preparation for all students. Failing to complete the readings will derail your progress and undermine our ability to build on prior material. For that reason, **late work is not accepted**, and any materials not submitted by the assigned deadline will be marked **incomplete**.

I am taking this opportunity to make my expectations for CMU students explicit. Course assignments are designed to reflect these expectations, and students will be graded accordingly. If you feel you need to strengthen any of the skills described below, please visit during office hours or schedule an appointment outside of the posted times.

## AI Use Policy for Student Work

As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly accessible, it is important to clarify expectations for their use in this course. You are welcome to use AI technologies (such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, or similar tools) to support your independent work—such as brainstorming ideas, checking grammar, or improving the clarity of your writing. However, you **may not use AI to generate substantive content that you submit as your own original work**. All assignments, essays, and projects must reflect your own analysis, critical thinking, and voice.

**Permitted Uses of AI:**

- Outlining or organizing your thoughts
- Checking grammar, spelling, or clarity
- Generating ideas or prompts to help you get started
- Reviewing your own drafts for readability

**Prohibited Uses of AI:**

- Submitting AI-generated essays, paragraphs, or answers as your own work
- Using AI to complete assignments, discussion posts, or projects in place of your own effort
- Copying and pasting AI-generated content without substantial revision and personal input

If you use AI tools in your process, you must **disclose** how you used them in a brief note at the end of your assignment (e.g., “I used ChatGPT to help brainstorm ideas for my outline.”).

**Violations:**  
Submitting AI-generated content as your own is considered academic dishonesty and will be treated as a violation of the university’s academic integrity policy.

If you have questions about what is or is not allowed, please ask before submitting your work.


## Representation Statement

I am committed to including a broad range of perspectives in the readings and materials for this course. If you believe a critical voice is missing, please let me know so I can improve the syllabus now and in future offerings.

**We must treat every individual with respect.** We come from many different backgrounds, and this variety of viewpoints is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. “Representation” can refer to the ways we identify ourselves—race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information, among others. Each of these identities shapes the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to campus. Promoting these varied viewpoints not only fuels excellence and innovation but also advances the pursuit of justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while fully committing to the work—inside and outside our classrooms—of building and sustaining a campus community that embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to an unwelcoming atmosphere for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and seek support—either in the moment or afterward. You can share your experiences using the following resources:

- **Ethics Reporting Hotline**  
  Submit an anonymous report by calling 844-587-0793 or visiting **cmu.ethicspoint.com**.  
  All reports are documented and reviewed to determine whether further action is needed. Regardless of the incident type, the university will use your feedback to transform our campus climate into one that is more equitable and just.


## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a documented disability and an accommodations letter from the Office of Disability Resources, please discuss your needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect you may have a disability and are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, you can contact them at **access@andrew.cmu.edu**.

## Student Well-Being

The past few years have been challenging. We are all under significant stress and uncertainty. I encourage you to find ways to move regularly, eat well, and reach out to your support system—or to me at **cervas@cmu.edu**—if you need help. We can all benefit from support during stressful times, and this semester is no exception.

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events can diminish your academic performance and reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. CMU offers services that can help, and treatment does work. Learn more about confidential mental health services available on campus at:

- **Counseling and Psychological Services**: http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/  
  Phone (24/7): 412-268-2922

Please remember that support is always available—don’t hesitate to reach out.
