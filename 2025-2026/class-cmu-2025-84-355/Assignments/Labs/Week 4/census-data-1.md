# Census Comparison Exercise: Redistricting Data vs. ACS

**Objective:** Practice downloading and comparing data from two Census sources — the **2020 Redistricting Data (PL 94-171)** and the **latest ACS 1-Year Estimates**.  
**Time:** ~25 minutes  


## Step 1. Form Your Group (2 minutes)

- Group Members: ____________________


## Step 2. Download Data (10 minutes)

### 2a. Redistricting Data (PL 94-171, 2020 Census)
1. Go to [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/).  
2. Search for **“PL 94-171 Redistricting Data”**.  
3. Select **State-level data** (choose all 50 states).  
4. Download the table with **total population**.   

### 2b. Latest ACS 1-Year Estimates
1. On [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/), search for **ACS 1-Year, Total Population**.  
2. Download **state-level data**.  


## Step 3. Calculate Growth Rate (5 minutes)

For each state, calculate the **growth rate** between 2020 Census (Redistricting data) and the ACS 1-Year estimate.  

$$
\text{Growth Rate (\%)} =
\frac{\text{ACS Population - Census 2020 Population}}
     {\text{Census 2020 Population}} \times 100
$$

- Example calculation (for one state):  
  Census 2020 Population = 10,711,908  
  ACS 1-Year Population = 10,912,876  
  Growth Rate = $((10{,}912{,}876 - 10{,}711{,}908)/10{,}711{,}908) \times 100 \approx 1.87\%$



## Step 4. Create a Plot (5–7 minutes)

Make a quick plot to show the growth rates. You may choose:  
- Bar chart (states on x-axis, growth rates on y-axis)  
- Map (shading states by growth rate)  
- Line plot (lines connecting change in population over time)  

Draw it by hand on paper **OR** use software (Excel, Google Sheets, R, Python).
