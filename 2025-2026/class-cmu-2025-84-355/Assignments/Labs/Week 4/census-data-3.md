# Census Data Comparison Exercise: Two Variables

**Objective:** Practice downloading Census data that combines two different variables and use it to make a comparison story.  
**Time:** ~25 minutes  

---

## Step 1. Name

- Name: _________________________________  


## Step 2. Choose a Question (2 minutes)

Pick one question to explore (or come up with your own).  

- How do **homeownership rates** differ by race/ethnicity in one state or city?  
- How do **median household incomes** differ by race/ethnicity?  
- How do **poverty rates** differ by age group or by educational attainment?  
- How does **educational attainment** differ by nativity (U.S.-born vs foreign-born)?  
- _________________________________ (your own idea)  


## Step 3. Find the Data (10 minutes)

1. Go to [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/).  
2. Search for an **ACS table** that matches your question. Examples:  
   - **B25003A–I**: Tenure (owner/renter) by race (separate tables for each race/ethnicity).  
   - **B19013A–I**: Median household income by race.  
   - **B17020**: Poverty status by age.  
   - **B15002**: Educational attainment by sex.  
3. Choose **state** or **county/city** level data.  
4. Record your table(s):  
   - Table ID(s): _________________________________  
   - Location: _________________________________  


## Step 4. Make a Comparison (8 minutes)

Do at least one comparison. Examples:  
- Compare homeownership rates for White vs. Black vs. Hispanic households.  
- Compare median household income by race in your state.  
- Compare poverty rates by age group.  

**Our Comparison:**  

Variable 1: _________________________________   
Variable 2: _________________________________   
Key comparison (in words): _________________________________   


## Step 5. Create a Visualization (5 minutes)

Choose a way to show your comparison:  
- Side-by-side bar chart  
- Stacked bar chart  
- Table with highlights  
- Simple sketch on paper  


## Step 6. Tell the Story (3 minutes)

Write 2–3 sentences interpreting your comparison.  

**Our Story:**
