# Census Data Storytelling

**Objective:** Work in small groups (2-3 persons) to explore the Census website, collect real data, and tell a short story about it.  

**Time:** ~25 minutes  

## Step 1. Form Your Group (2 minutes)

- Group Members: _________________________________  
- Theme (pick one or create your own):  
  - Population growth/decline  
  - Race & ethnicity  
  - Age distribution  
  - Housing (renter vs owner)  
  - Income & poverty  
  - Education  

## Step 2. Find Data (10 minutes)

1. Go to [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/) or [QuickFacts](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/).  
2. Choose a location (state, county, or city).  
   - Location: _________________________________  
3. Download or view one table with information related to your theme.  
   - Table ID (if available): _________________________________  
   - Key variable(s) you are focusing on: _________________________________  

## Step 3. Tell a Data Story (8 minutes)

Write a short story (2â€“3 sentences) about what you found. Try making a comparison (local vs. state, change over time, group vs. group).  

**Our Story:**  

Example:  
> "In Richmond, VA, more than half of households rent their homes, which is much higher than the statewide average. This may help explain why housing costs are a big local political issue."

Add specific data numbers or percentages to enhance the example.


## Step 4. Share Out (5 minutes)

Be ready to share your story with the class.
