# Questionnaire Design Activity

The purpose of this activity is to think about how to write good questions on surveys. The focus
here is on measuring evaluative questions (i.e., those about a respondent’s opinions, attitudes,
values, etc.). Each item below is a concept that we might want to operationalize in a survey
questionnaire. For each item, generate two (2) possible ways of measuring this concept. Then,
weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. For example, you might want to consider
any of the following features:

- Is the question easy for respondents to understand? Might the question (or the answer
  options) require clarification after being read?
- Are the number and types of response options appropriate? Are the categories sufficiently
  distinct from one another?
- Is a “no opinion,” “don’t know,” or “neither support nor oppose” response option available?
- Is one survey item (i.e., one question) sufficient to measure this construct?
- How long does it take to read and answer this question?
