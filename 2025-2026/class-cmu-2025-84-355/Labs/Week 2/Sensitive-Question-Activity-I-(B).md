# Sensitive Question Activity I (B)

The purpose of this activity is to think about sensitive topics on surveys.  
This activity will help you to consider how respondents experience sensitive topics.

---

## Partner Activity

You are going to play the role of interviewer and respondent to experience firsthand how potentially sensitive questions work in a face-to-face survey interview.  
Importantly: Do **NOT** answer the questions.  

For each question, write down how you felt as the interviewer asking the question or how you felt as the respondent in attempting to answer the question.  

Your partner has a different version of the questionnaire than you. Take turns in each role.

### Interviewer Questions
1. A lot of people are unable to get out and vote for many reasons. Did you happen to vote in the last **U.S. presidential election**?  
2. Regardless of whether or not you think it should be legal, please tell me whether you personally believe that in general it is morally acceptable or morally wrong for married men and women to have an affair?  
3. How does your current monthly household income compare to what it was twelve months ago? Would you say it is significantly higher now, about the same versus twelve months ago, or significantly lower now?  
4. Have you ever stolen anything from a current or former employer?  
5. To what extent do you agree with the following statement?  
   “One of the worst things a person could do is hurt a defenseless animal.”  
6. There are several diseases or infections that can be transmitted during sex. At any point in time, have you ever been told by a doctor that you had a sexually transmitted disease?  
7. During your time in university, have you ever cheated on an exam?

## Individual Activity

Please read the following questions as if you were completing the survey for real.  
You do **NOT** need to record your answers.  

Instead, write down what goes through your mind as you answer each question.  
We will discuss those feelings and reactions in general terms after you are finished.

- Do you believe in God?  
- When you were a child, were you raised by both of your parents in the same household, by both parents about equally but in different households, raised mainly by your mother, raised mainly by your father, or were you raised by someone else?  
- Thinking of your current relationship with your spouse or partner (or, if you are not currently in a relationship, a past spouse/partner), have you ever become so angry that one of you lost control and either yelled, broke things or tried to hurt your partner?  
- If your spouse or romantic partner made more money than you, would it threaten the relationship?  
- If you had a child who told you he or she was gay or lesbian, would you be very upset, somewhat upset, not very upset, or not upset at all?  
- Within the last twelve months, have you or any member of your household been sexually assaulted or raped?  
- Thinking about the time since your 18th birthday, have you ever had sex with a person you paid or who paid you for sex?  
- How often do you feel you have to lie or cheat? Often, occasionally, rarely, or never?  
- Do you favor or oppose making it more difficult to access pornography on the Internet?  
- In the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, how much do you sympathize with the Palestinians? A lot, some, not much, or not at all?  
- Just your impression, in the United States today, is there a lot of discrimination against Muslims, or not?  
- If marijuana were legalized for recreational use in the United States, would you definitely use it, probably use it, probably not use it, or definitely not use it?  
- Overall, how well would you say your mental or emotional health needs are being met today? Very well, somewhat well, not too well, or not at all well?
