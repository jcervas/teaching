## Short Description:

Explore the forces shaping American democracy through the power of data.
This course blends political science and analytics to uncover patterns
in voting, campaigns, and electoral outcomes — past and present.

## Course Description:

American democracy is rich with data — from historical vote tallies to
modern polling, turnout, and campaign finance. In this course, we’ll
investigate how democracy functions by analyzing this data, uncovering
the political, social, and structural forces that shape electoral
outcomes. Students will engage with historical case studies (e.g., 1876,
1960, 2000) alongside contemporary elections to see how past events
illuminate present dynamics. Through lectures, labs, and projects,
students will gain the tools to collect, analyze, and interpret
electoral data — and apply these skills to real-world political
questions.

## Course Goals

By the end of this course, students will: - Understand how data can
illuminate the functioning of democratic systems. - Identify historical
and contemporary forces that shape electoral outcomes. - Apply
quantitative methods to analyze and interpret election data. - Connect
patterns in data to broader questions about political power,
representation, and change.

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to: 1. Collect and clean real-world electoral
datasets. 2. Conduct (basic) statistical analyses to identify trends in
voting behavior. 3. Interpret and visualize election data for academic
and public audiences. 4. Evaluate the impact of historical events on
present electoral dynamics. 5. Critically assess the strengths and
limitations of various data sources.

## **Assignments**

1.  **Current Events Data Snippets:**

    - For each class, you must submit one piece of relevant data on the
      Canvas discussion board.
    - This data should be pertinent to the upcoming class discussion and
      reflect current events.
    - You can access free articles and archives from the New York Times
      and other major newspapers using your `cmu.edu` email.
    - You may be called on randomly to share your data nugget.
    - I will create a shared powerpoint where you can post your slide.
    - They will be graded on a completion basis (complete/incomplete).

    > **Example:**  
    > *Voter Turnout*: “About two-thirds (66%) of the voting-eligible
    > population turned out for the 2020 presidential election” [**Pew
    > Research
    > Center**](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/).
    > Create info-graphic visualizations to illustrate the data.

2.  **Weekly Lab Assignments**

    - Each week, you will complete a lab assignment that involves
      analyzing a dataset related to the week’s topic.
    - These assignments will help you practice data cleaning, analysis,
      and visualization techniques.
    - The assignments will be graded on a completion basis
      (complete/incomplete).

3.  **Policy Proposals:**  
    Develop a policy proposal that addresses a specific issue in the
    electoral process, such as increasing voter turnout, ensuring
    election security, or improving poll accuracy. Your proposal should
    be supported by data and historical analysis. (Due December 5. 2-4
    single-spaced pages, not including visualizations).  
    You will be responsible for reading two of your peer’s work, and
    providing feedback (and your feedback will be graded). You will also
    provide a grade, which I will average. *If you feel you deserve a
    different grade, I am happy to evaluate it before the end of the
    semester.* However, I reserve the right to **lower** the grade as I
    see fit.

4.  **Attendance:**  
    Regular attendance and active involvement form a significant part of
    your final grade (see grading section). If you do not show up, you
    will not earn an ‘A’. Participation is not just about being present;
    it involves engaging with the material, contributing to discussions,
    and collaborating with your peers. To recognize that occasional
    absences are sometimes unavoidable (e.g., for religious observance,
    job interviews, university-sanctioned events, or illness),
    attendance grades will be calculated using an exponential function.
    1–2 absences → mild penalty, 6+ absences → sharp drop (serious
    consequences).

    $$s(A) = 100 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1 - e^{-kA}}{1 - e^{-kT}} \right)$$

    where $$k=0.1$$ and $$A$$ is the your number of absences and $$T$$
    is the total number of classes.

Students are expected and encouraged to meet all deadlines for
assignments. If you are unable to complete the assignment work by the
due date, reach out in advance to make alternative arrangements. I
typically will not penalize you for turning in your assignment late, so
long as it does not hinder completion of other’s work (ie, group
projects).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The course grade will be a weighted average of the following components:

Category \| Percent of Final Grade \|

\|\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*-\|\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\|
\| **Participation & Attendance** \| 20% \| \| **Weekly Lab
Assignments** \| 50% \| \| **Midterm Project** \| 10% \| \| **Policy
Proposal** \| 10% \| \| **Weekly Data Contributions** \| 10% \|

## AI Use Policy for Student Work

As artificial intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly accessible, it
is important to clarify expectations for their use in this course. You
are welcome to use AI technologies (such as ChatGPT, Grammarly, or
similar tools) to support your independent work—such as brainstorming
ideas, checking grammar, or improving the clarity of your writing.
However, you **may not use AI to generate substantive content that you
submit as your own original work**. All assignments, essays, and
projects must reflect your own analysis, critical thinking, and voice.

**Permitted Uses of AI:**

- Outlining or organizing your thoughts
- Checking grammar, spelling, or clarity
- Generating ideas or prompts to help you get started
- Reviewing your own drafts for readability

**Prohibited Uses of AI:**

- Submitting AI-generated essays, paragraphs, or answers as your own
  work
- Using AI to complete assignments, discussion posts, or projects in
  place of your own effort
- Copying and pasting AI-generated content without substantial revision
  and personal input

If you use AI tools in your process, you must **disclose** how you used
them in a brief note at the end of your assignment (e.g., “I used
ChatGPT to help brainstorm ideas for my outline.”).

**Violations:**  
Submitting AI-generated content as your own is considered academic
dishonesty and will be treated as a violation of the university’s
academic integrity policy.

If you have questions about what is or is not allowed, please ask before
submitting your work.

## Representation Statement

I am committed to including a broad range of perspectives in the
readings and materials for this course. If you believe a critical voice
is missing, please let me know so I can improve the syllabus now and in
future offerings.

**We must treat every individual with respect.** We come from many
different backgrounds, and this variety of viewpoints is fundamental to
building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community.
“Representation” can refer to the ways we identify ourselves—race,
color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual
orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran
status, or genetic information, among others. Each of these identities
shapes the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to
campus. Promoting these varied viewpoints not only fuels excellence and
innovation but also advances the pursuit of justice. We acknowledge our
imperfections while fully committing to the work—inside and outside our
classrooms—of building and sustaining a campus community that embraces
these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive
environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether
intentional or unintentional. They contribute to an unwelcoming
atmosphere for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the
university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or
hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and
seek support—either in the moment or afterward. You can share your
experiences using the following resources:

- **Ethics Reporting Hotline**  
  Submit an anonymous report by calling 844-587-0793 or visiting
  **cmu.ethicspoint.com**.  
  All reports are documented and reviewed to determine whether further
  action is needed. Regardless of the incident type, the university will
  use your feedback to transform our campus climate into one that is
  more equitable and just.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a documented disability and an accommodations letter from
the Office of Disability Resources, please discuss your needs with me as
early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that
accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect you may have
a disability and are not yet registered with the Office of Disability
Resources, you can contact them at **<access@andrew.cmu.edu>**.

## Student Well-Being

The past few years have been challenging. We are all under significant
stress and uncertainty. I encourage you to find ways to move regularly,
eat well, and reach out to your support system—or to me at
**<cervas@cmu.edu>**—if you need help. We can all benefit from support
during stressful times, and this semester is no exception.

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that interfere
with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety,
substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating, or lack of
motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events can
diminish your academic performance and reduce your ability to
participate in daily activities. CMU offers services that can help, and
treatment does work. Learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at:

- **Counseling and Psychological Services**:
  <http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/>  
  Phone (24/7): 412-268-2922

Please remember that support is always available—don’t hesitate to reach
out.
