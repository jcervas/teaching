“*One can learn data analysis only by doing, not by reading*” - Kosuke
Imai

How do we evaluate empirical claims about events we see around the
world? Can we measure discrimination in job hiring? What is the best way
to predict election outcomes? What factors drive the onset of civil
wars? Is it possible to determine what members of Congress are more or
less liberal given their voting record? These are just a few of the
numerous question that social scientists are tackling with quantitative
data. Beyond academia, companies and non-profits have invested heavily
in data science techniques to learn about their users, platforms, and
programs. Data scientists at these institutions are essentially applied
social scientists and employ many of the same techniques you will learn
in this course. The goal is to provide students with the foundation
necessary to analyze data in their own research and to become critical
consumers of statistical claims made in the news media, in policy
reports, and in academic research.

### Course Description

This course encompasses two primary objectives. Initially, it equips
students with a comprehensive understanding of writing an good master’s
thesis. Students will gain insights into the essential components of the
thesis and their significance, aiding them in developing their thesis
proposals. By the conclusion of this course, students will have prepared
a preliminary thesis draft. While this draft may not include the final
data, learners will be expected to identify data sources and formulate a
detailed strategy for completing their thesis.

The second objective focuses on providing students with quantitative
methodologies necessary for investigating empirical queries pertinent to
their research themes and hypotheses. The curriculum extends beyond the
basics of Ordinary Least Squares regression, delving into models
tailored for varied dependent variables. It addresses challenges like
missing data, the utilization of textual and spatial data, and the
intricacies of experimental and regression discontinuity designs.
Additionally, the course explores simulations, the fundamental problem
of social science research, i.e., causality, prediction models, and
probability. While some topics may seem familiar, revisiting them is
intended to enhance the understanding of these complex methods.

### Learning Objectives

The primary aim of this course is to equip you with the necessary skills
for successfully writing your thesis. As you progress through the
semester, you will acquire a diverse set of analytical tools, essential
for exploring the empirical aspects of your research questions.
Furthermore, the course is designed to hone abilities that will be
invaluable in your subsequent roles as data specialists.

Upon successful completion of this course, you will have the proficiency
to:

- Effectively engage in political science writing that meets
  professional standards.
- Navigate through the research process, recognizing various research
  methodologies and potential obstacles.
- Craft a robust research plan.
- Perform data cleaning tasks.
- Execute statistical evaluations.
- Formulate a comprehensive proposal for your master’s thesis.

### Prerequisite Knowledge

I assume that everyone enrolled in this course has satisfactorily
completed RAPS I.

### Material

Our primary text will be Data Analysis for Social Science by Kosuke Imai
and Elena Llaudet. Problem Sets will be taken from material in ***DSS***
and from Imai’s other book, Quantitative Social Science (*QSS*). They
will be made available, but can also downloaded as a ZIP at
<https://press.princeton.edu/student-resources/data-analysis-for-social-science>
and
<https://press.princeton.edu/student-resources/quantitative-social-science>

(***DSS***) Elena Llaudet and Kosuke Imai. 2022. Data Analysis for
Social Science. Princeton University Press.

(***Sage Research Methods***). *Project Planner*. 2017.
<https://methods.sagepub.com/project-planner/>. DOI:
10.4135/9781526408495.

We may also use various material found on the internet. I offer some
additional resources you may want to explore on your own if you want
more advanced or specific methods.

### Grading

I care the most about what you learn, not what numerical/letter summary
of that learning you get at the end of the semester. So I would love to
not have grades at all, but the university does not agree. Thus, we have
grades to help encourage you to put effort into learning the course
material, and to satisfy the university overlords.

### Assessment

The course grade will be a weighted average of the following components:

| Category            | Percent of Final Grade |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Problem Sets (\~10) | 25%                    |
| Thesis Reports      | 25%                    |
| Presentations       | 20%                    |
| Thesis Proposal     | 30%                    |

### R Programming

In this course, the R programming language will be utilized exclusively.
You will be required to run all code within the `R` environment and
employ `RMarkdown` for all Assignments. We will thoroughly explain these
tools during the initial class session. It is essential that you have R,
RStudio, and RMarkdown installed and operational on your computer by the
second week of the course. To ensure your readiness, there is a brief
Assignments with detailed instructions, which must be completed by the
deadline specified on Canvas and in the schedule provided below.

Install `R` on your system. Follow these step-by-step instructions if
you have issues: <https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/install-r/>

I have found this tutorial to be helpful. Please complete it before the
second week of class: <https://www.stephenpettigrew.com/r/>

Here is another one, including an `RMarkdown` Demo: -
<https://www.miacosta.net/teaching/r-tutorials>

Your ability to independently seek and access assistance is a vital
aspect of your learning experience with a statistical programming
language. If you encounter challenges with R or require support for
statistical analysis during the course, please utilize the following
resources in the specified order:

1.  **In-App Help:** Within R, you can access help for any command by
    entering `?` followed by the command in the R console. For example,
    `?summary` provides details on the summary command. Please note that
    R’s built-in help documentation can be complex.

2.  **Online Search:** When facing specific questions, problems, or
    error messages in `R`, conduct a Google search followed by “in R”
    (e.g., “changing legend colors using barplot() in R”). Many
    individuals have likely encountered similar issues, and websites
    such as Stack Overflow often offer solutions to a wide range of
    queries. Additionally, you can seek assistance from ChatGPT at this
    stage, adhering to our AI usage policy. ***This should be your
    initial or secondary step before reaching out to the instructor or
    others for assistance.***

3.  **rseek.org - rstats Search Engine:** Utilize rseek.org, a
    specialized search engine that filters Google results for R-related
    information.

4.  **Course Resources:** Review the R code and tutorials shared within
    our course materials.

5.  **Collaboration with Peers:** Embrace collaborative learning by
    engaging with your fellow students, as collaborative problem-solving
    is encouraged in this academic environment.

6.  **Online Learning Materials:** Explore these online learning
    resources:

    - [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)
    - [Quick-R: Home Page](https://www.statmethods.net/)
    - [R Koujue - Statistical Software - Research
      Guides](https://researchguides.cmu.edu/r)

These resources have been curated and maintained by experts in the
field, and you are encouraged to reach out to them directly for
clarifications or additional guidance.

7.  **Contacting Course Instructors:** In case you require further
    assistance, feel free to reach out to your course instructor via
    email or during their office hours. Ensure you provide a thorough
    description of your issue, along with your code and relevant
    screenshots. This information will assist them in understanding and
    addressing your problem. While you are always welcome to engage with
    your instructors for discussions on course content or any other
    academic matters, please make an earnest attempt to utilize the
    above resources for specific coding questions or R-related
    challenges. Instructors may inquire about your prior efforts when
    you reach out.

### Swirl

Each week, students should utilize swirl lessons that are available at
<https://github.com/kosukeimai/qss-swirl> and can be answered within R.
The topics correspond to the book chapters. These are for your
development and are ungraded.

To start the review questions, users must first install the swirl
package and then the lessons for this book using the following three
lines of commands. Note that this installation needs to be done only
once at the beginning.

## Assignments

### Problem Sets

To only read about data science is about as useful as reading the entire
DMV handbook and memorizing all state driving laws, and then to show up
to a Formula 1 race expecting to win. You need to drive.

Thus, in this course, you will have problem sets to complete throughout
the semester that will give you an opportunity to apply the statistical
techniques you are learning. They will usually be focused on data
analysis in general and will often involve a real dataset. I encourage
students to rely on peer working groups as they work on these questions,
but each student will submit their own work individually. We will have
class time to work on these. You will turn in the problem set in the
form of a “.Rmd” file on Canvas by Sunday at 11:59pm.

### Presentations

Each student will be expected to give two presentations: One right after
spring break evaluating the status of their proposal, and a final
presentation of their proposal on the last day of class.

#### Final Thesis Proposal

The main written product of the course is the Thesis Proposal, which
will be signed off by your Thesis Advisor and uploaded to Canvas before
May 13 to receive credit.

- **Methodology** (\~1000 words):
  - Describe two research designs, a qualitative and a quantitative one.
    You could follow only one in your thesis, but it is still a useful
    exercise that will help you to explore the potential empirical
    limits of your thesis. First, discuss the reasoning for your case
    selection and your data collection strategy. Make sure to justify
    the cases you will select, the data you will analyze, and the
    methods that you will use for testing your theory. If you have
    preliminary data, I encourage you to show it in tables and figures.
  - For the qualitative RD, discuss in detail whether you will conduct
    case studies, interviews, focus groups, ethnographic research,
    archival analysis, or process tracing. For example, if you plan to
    conduct interviews, make sure to describe who you will interview,
    why, and the type of questions you plan to ask. Also, whether the
    interviews will be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured, and
    closed-ended, open-ended, hypothetical, etc. For the quantitative
    portion, explain the units of analysis, how you will collect the
    data, and the research techniques that you will use to test your
    hypotheses. For example, explain whether you will conduct surveys,
    experiments, game theory, or statistical analyses. If you will use
    statistics, explain the techniques to be used, and justify them.

        on your hypotheses. Include “dummy graphics” of data
        visualizations that show your expected findings using the
        resources above. Reiterate how you expect your findings to
        contribute to the broader literature on this topic, taking into
        account any remaining threats to validity that could not be
        controlled for.

### Week 14. 04/16 - Is There Racial Discrimination in the Labor Market?
