## Objective
Analyze a contentious legislative districting plan to determine its legal compliance. You serve as an expert witnes for the plaintiffs. Compare the enacted plan with your "YOUR-LAST-NAME illustrative plan". The report length will vary with the option you choose, excluding appendices with tables and maps.

## Instructions
1. Research redistricting laws, including state and federal statutes.
2. Examine the specified election's districting plan (refer to DRA for the map), including its development and execution.
3. Review your illustrative plan and two other alternatives. Compare these with the districting plan, focusing on legal compliance.
4. Write a report containing:
   - Introduction outlining purpose and legal redistricting standards.
   - Detailed analysis of the plan, identifying potential legal issues.
   - Comparisons with your plan and two others, assessing legal compliance.
   - Conclusion summarizing findings and legality opinion.
   - Appendices with supporting tables and maps.
   - DRA page links for all plans.
5. Ensure a 3 to 6 page length (excluding appendices). Include all plan links to DRA.

## Team Collaboration and Technical Report Option
- **Team Report**: Work with up to three others. Evaluate each member's map, choosing one as the primary for comparison. Extend page length to 5-10 pages.
- **Technical Expert Witness [Team]**: Collaborate in a group, incorporating technical analysis (e.g., using `GerryChain` or `rdist`). Minimum report length is 6 pages, with a maximum of 12. Teams can include up to seven students.

## Notes
- Begin with a review of pertinent laws, cases, and news sources related to the districting plan.
