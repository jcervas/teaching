### Course Description:

Democracy in the United States is looking a bit rickety. A notable
portion of the American populace, often long before any ballots are
cast, holds a persistent belief that the electoral process is flawed or
‘rigged’. This sentiment is exacerbated by instances where the
majority’s preferences seem to be ignored or sidelined. In recent years,
there have been notable shifts in the judiciary, with long-established
legal precedents being overturned, often contrary to widespread public
opinion. Additionally, the progress achieved in the realm of voting
rights since the 1960s is facing setbacks in numerous states. A
particularly alarming indication of the vulnerability of our democratic
institutions occurred three years ago with the then-president’s
unconstitutional attempts to maintain power, culminating in a violent
insurrection against the U.S. government.

This course will provide an in-depth exploration of the essential
aspects of representation and voting rights, concentrating on ensuring
election integrity, achieving fair redistricting, and promoting a just
democracy. We will examine the historical trajectory of voting rights in
the U.S., confront contemporary challenges to our democratic processes,
and consider a range of reforms to strengthen democratic representation
in our society. Additionally, we will discuss how political polarization
is impacting even non-political institutions. An example of this is the
recent campaign against the former president of Harvard, who was both
the university’s first Black president and second female president. Her
academic background in political science, with a focus overlapping this
course’s content, adds relevance to this discussion.

The course is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of
these issues, encouraging critical analysis and informed debate about
the state and future of democracy in the United States. The course will
combine lectures with interactive discussions, case studies, guest
speakers, and project-based learning. Students will engage in critical
analysis of current events, participate in simulations, and conduct
research projects to propose solutions for enhancing democratic
representation.

### Key Topics:

- **Historical Overview of Voting Rights**: Tracing the development of
  voting rights from the founding of the United States to the present
  day, with a focus on key legislation and court cases.
- **Election Systems and Their Impact**: Analysis of different electoral
  systems and their effects on political representation and voter
  engagement.
- **Redistricting and Gerrymandering**: Exploring the process of
  redistricting, its impact on political representation, and the ongoing
  debate over gerrymandering.
- **Challenges to Equitable Democracy**: Investigating contemporary
  challenges such as voter suppression, electoral integrity, and
  political polarization.
- **Reform and the Future of Democracy**: Discussing potential reforms
  like ranked-choice voting, redistricting commissions, and campaign
  finance reform, and their potential to create a more equitable
  democratic system.

### Prerequisite Knowledge:

None required. This course will begin with the most basic understanding
of democratic processes and attempt to “build the puzzle” of the complex
systems that make up our representative democracy. Redistricting will be
done on laptop computer running Dave’s Redistricting App. Computer
programming is optional but encouraged for those with `Python` or `R`
skills.

### Credits:

This course is suitable for both undergraduate \[9 units\] and graduate
students \[12 units\].

### Course Relevance:

The current state of democracy in the United States presents critical
issues, particularly in how public opinion translates into governmental
actions and outcomes. This course is crafted to delve deeply into the
concept of representation. Though we will discuss the history of voting
rights in the US, we will use it to contextualize the current state of
American democracy.

Our study places significant emphasis on redistricting, which involves
the redrawing of legislative and congressional district boundaries. Data
from Google Trends indicates that public interest in redistricting
reached its zenith in February 2022, and it continues to be a topic of
considerable importance and attention. We will explore a range of
boundary-drawing techniques aimed at achieving equitable representation
and reflecting the diversity of communities. An important part of our
discussion will focus on how district boundaries might be manipulated,
potentially undermining minority representation or unduly entrenching a
political party’s dominance, which may not align with the electorate’s
preferences. Beyond theoretical knowledge, this course involves
practical engagement in redistricting through the use of geographic
information systems software, contributing meaningfully to the
redistricting processes of state and local governments. To accommodate
various interests, the course includes specialized tracks in computer
science, mathematics, law, and geography, each focusing on different
aspects of redistricting.

Our journey will also encompass an exploration of the ‘one person, one
vote’ principle, a comprehensive understanding of the US Census and its
implications, an analysis of the Electoral College’s influence in
elections, and an examination of federalism in the context of vertical
representation, as well as the system of checks and balances integral to
horizontal representation. We will pay close attention to the evolution
and present challenges of the right to vote, highlighting key debates
and issues in contemporary voting rights.

This course fundamentally addresses how representation in government
mirrors public opinion and electoral results, extending to broader
societal sentiments. Although focusing mainly on the United States, we
will draw comparative insights from democratic systems in other
countries. Recent trends towards anti-majoritarian outcomes in the U.S.,
raising concerns about the electoral link, will be a topic of analysis.

### Summary:

Throughout this course, we will delve into the multifaceted concept of
representation, focusing on three key areas: 1) the intricacies of
voting rights, 2) the dynamics of electoral democracy and
representation, and 3) the technicalities of formal representation,
particularly redistricting. While the primary lens of our study will be
the American political system, the universality of democracy and
representation means that we may also draw valuable insights from other
global systems.

Our exploration will begin with an in-depth look at the theoretical
foundations of representation, framed within the context of democratic
norms and the legal and constitutional frameworks that define U.S.
institutions. A significant portion of the course will be dedicated to a
historical review of voting rights in America, tracing their evolution
and current state.

A crucial aspect of legislative elections in the U.S. is their
organization in single-member districts, necessitating the redrawing of
district boundaries every ten years. We will allocate several weeks to
thoroughly understand this redistricting process. This will not only
include learning how to create legally compliant electoral maps but also
exploring the potential for and implications of manipulated districting,
which can yield partisan or racial advantages. Additionally, we will
develop the skills to identify and assess features in redistricting
plans that may indicate such biases.

### Learning Objectives:

Over the course of this class, students will acquire a comprehensive
understanding of the political landscape, particularly in the context of
voting and elections, through the lenses of law, political science,
mathematics, sociology, and computer science. They will develop the
ability to critically assess various electoral systems, recognizing
their respective strengths and weaknesses in terms of representation and
policy outcomes. A key focus will be on the correlation between voting
rights and the lived experiences and opportunities of different groups.
This exploration will extend to understanding the significance of voting
rights across diverse communities, how these variations shed light on
necessary improvements, and the impact of institutional design on
incentive structures, including the potential for institutional biases
against minority groups under majority rule systems. Students will also
gain insights into how electoral system selection can address structural
discrimination against minority groups.

The curriculum includes a thorough study of the US Census and the
process of decennial reapportionment. Students will gain practical
skills in designing legally compliant political district maps and
analyze how the delineation of legislative districts can
disproportionately affect groups, particularly marginalized ones,
possibly leading to their under-representation. The course will cover
data analysis techniques, introducing advanced methodologies from
computer science and mathematics. Furthermore, students will devise
strategies to reduce inequalities in voting rights and foster a more
equitable society.

By the end of this course, students will be proficient in applying
methodologies from their own academic discipline to identify and rectify
shortcomings in voting systems, as well as in incorporating techniques
from other disciplines to enhance democratic problem-solving approaches.

### Assignments:

#### Professor and TA Office Hours:

It is mandatory for undergraduate students to participate in at least
one office hour session during the semester, either with the professor
or a teaching assistant (TA). The professor will have scheduled office
hours each week and is also accessible for meetings by appointment.
Teaching assistants will also be available for consultation, with their
specific office hours announced on Canvas. Additionally, there might be
informal gatherings titled “Lunch with the Professor”, where students
are invited to join the professor at a specified location (Conference
Room on the third floor of Posner Hall) for a bring-your-own-lunch
meeting.

#### Book Review:

For your assignment, you have the flexibility to choose a book from the
provided list (or select any other book that aligns with the themes of
representation or voting rights, with approval from the instructor).
Your task is to craft a comprehensive review of the chosen book. This
review should include a succinct summary of the book’s content. Beyond
the summary, I encourage you to engage critically with the book,
reflecting on the author’s approach to the subject matter. Discuss
aspects the author excelled in, as well as any potential weaknesses you
perceive in their treatment of the topic. Feel free to explore
possibilities for future research that the book might suggest, or
consider the relevance of the book’s evidence and arguments in the
context of current political and social scenarios. Your book review
should be concise and insightful, spanning no more than 5 single-spaced
pages, although a well-articulated review might be effectively conveyed
in as few as 3 pages.

*Graduate Student Requirements*: Each graduate student is required to
conduct reviews of two distinct books. It’s important that each graduate
student selects a unique book for their review, and a sign-up document
will be provided by the instructor to facilitate this process. In
addition to the written review, graduate students will also prepare a
PowerPoint presentation, approximately 10 minutes in length, to
accompany their review. This presentation should succinctly summarize
the main arguments of the book, provide essential context for
understanding the author’s conclusions, and present a critical analysis
of the work. Your analysis should cover your perspectives on how
effectively the author approached the subject, the strengths and
weaknesses you’ve identified in the work, and the relevance of the
book’s content to current political and social issues. The aim of the
presentation is to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of your
book review, engaging your peers in the critical aspects of the book and
your assessment of its contribution to the study of representation or
voting rights.

#### In-class exercises:

Throughout the semester, we will have several in-class exercises. These
are short, creative-type assignments designed to support your other
assignments and to provoke thoughtful evaluations of our democracy. You
will be able to collaborate in teams, but each student must submit
individually. You will begin these in class and will have until the
following day at midnight to submit on Canvas. They will be graded as
either satisfactorily completed or in-complete. You can miss up to one
exercise and still receive full points. This replaces “participation” as
part of your grade, and can not be excused or made up.

#### Redistricting Plan (400-600 words):

Create a legislative plan for a specified region consisting of a
predetermined number of districts. Your plan should aim for fairness as
you interpret it, necessitating deliberate design. Write a concise
report explaining why your plan is fair. Limit your report to one
single-spaced page and include maps and tables to display statistics
about your plan (like compactness scores, population deviation, and
minority representation). You may also discuss any preserved communities
of interest.

#### Plan Comparison (1000-1500 words):

Compare various alternative plans created by your classmates for the
same region. Analyze at least three plans, comparing them to the map
adopted by the region’s legislative body, which might be challenged for
biases such as partisanship or racial gerrymandering. Your comparison
should include traditional criteria and measures of partisan and racial
equity. Prepare a succinct write-up, capped at three single-spaced
pages, and enhance your analysis with maps, tables, and other visuals
(not included in page count).

*Alternative Technical Comparison*: Instead of the plan comparison, you
will use computer simulation to generate and assess alternative
districting plans for the specified region, focusing on the fairness and
legality of the enacted plan. Use either `GerryChain` (Python) or
`rdist` (R) for this analysis. Compare each simulated plan to the
region’s 2023 legislative plan. This involves critically analyzing
redistricting plans, emphasizing computer simulation over creating new
plans from scratch.

#### Expert Witness Report:

There are three options for this final assignment: 1) working alone 2)
working with a team, both without doing technical work 3) working as a
team to create a technical supplement

*Non-Technical Report \[solo\]* (1500-3000 words): Expanding on your
previous assignments and classwork, you will draft a report analyzing a
legislative plan for the specified region. Imagine being hired to
evaluate this plan in comparison to your own (referred to as
“YOUR-LAST-NAME illustrative plan”). In your report, argue why the
enacted plan could be considered unlawful. Reference reports by yourself
or others as expert witnesses (available on your website). The report
should range from 3 to 6 single-spaced pages (excluding tables and maps)
and include links to each plan’s DRA page for accessibility. Start by
summarizing the legal requirements for a redistricting plan in the
region, incorporating relevant state and federal laws.

*Non-Technical Report \[team\]* (2500-5000 words): Collaboration with up
to three others is allowed. If working in a team, evaluate each member’s
map, choosing one as the primary illustrative map and others for
comparison. For team reports, extend the page limit to a maximum of 10
pages (minimum of 5 pages for team efforts).

*Technical Expert Witness \[team\]* (3000-6000 words): Collaborate with
a group working on an non-technical report, using your findings to
bolster their argument against the enacted plan. The minimum page length
for submissions including this analysis is 6 pages, with a maximum of 12
single-spaced pages. Teams can expand to seven students for this option.

#### Midterm and Final Exam

Exams will be conducted at two points during the semester. These exams
will be multiple choice, true/false, or short answer. They will largely
be based on the readings, but may include questions related to lectures.
These are not intended to be difficult but instead to assess whether or
not you did the required readings throughout the semester.

#### *Graduate Students* Daily Questions

By the end of each day in which we have class, you will submit three
questions (multiple choice, true/false, short answer) based on the
readings assigned that day. These will be used as the basis for the
midterm and final exams.

### Laptop and Electronic Device Policy

In this course, the use of laptops and other electronic devices is
permitted with the understanding that they are powerful tools for
learning when used appropriately. However, it’s crucial to recognize
that any usage outside of regular course-related activities can be a
significant distraction to both the user and surrounding peers.
Therefore, the following guidelines are established:

1.  **Focused Usage**: Devices should be used solely for academic
    purposes relevant to the class. This includes note-taking, looking
    up relevant information, and accessing course materials.

2.  **Minimizing Distractions**:

    - Ensure that all device notifications are muted to avoid
      disruptions.
    - Refrain from browsing non-academic websites, using social media,
      instant messaging, streaming content, gaming, or engaging in any
      other activities unrelated to the course.

3.  **Respectful and Courteous Behavior**:

    - Keep your screen content appropriate for the classroom
      environment.
    - Avoid screen brightness levels and content that might distract
      others.

4.  **Active Participation**: Your engagement in class discussions and
    activities should not be hindered by device usage. Devices should
    enhance, not detract from, your learning experience.

5.  **Accommodations for Disabilities**: Students who require specific
    accommodations for effective use of electronic devices should
    contact the Disability Services office.

6.  **Instructor Authority**: The instructor reserves the right to ask
    any student to close their device if it’s being used for
    non-academic purposes or causing distractions.

Non-compliance with these guidelines may lead to the loss of the
privilege to use electronic devices in class and could impact
participation grades.

*The instructor may modify this policy as necessary and will communicate
any changes promptly.*

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:

Academic Integrity is a core CMU value, and as a member of the CMU
community, it is important that the work you turn in for this class is
wholly your own. As your instructor, I will strive to ensure that you
develop the necessary knowledge and skills to meet the learning
objectives for this class, just as it is your task to put in the effort
to complete the work and ask for help if you need it. I do not like when
politicians steal power from some voters, and likewise I do not like
when students steal other’s intellectual property. Do not do it, it is
not worth it. I have created a course that everyone can be, and should
be, successful.

As a reminder all students should follow CMU’s Academic Integrity
Policy.

### ACCOMMODATIONS FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the
Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your
accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I
will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as
appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would
benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office
of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
<access@andrew.cmu.edu>.

### STUDENT WELLNESS:

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can
interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased
anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or
lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to
participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and

### DIVERSITY STATEMENT:

It is my goal to create an inclusive and equitable learning environment
in this course, where the diversity of all students is acknowledged,
respected, and valued as a resource and strength. I will strive to
address the learning needs of all students, both in and out of class,
and will incorporate materials and activities that are respectful of
diversity in terms of gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic
status, ethnicity, race, and culture. I welcome and encourage feedback
on ways to improve the course for all students, and am happy to
accommodate any religious observances that may conflict with class
meetings.

### AI POLICY

AI is a powerful tool that can be used to enhance the learning
experience for students. However, it is important to approach the use of
AI with a positive attitude and a respect for its capabilities and
limitations. This policy outlines the guidelines for using AI in the
classroom, with a focus on creating a positive and inclusive environment
for all students.

##### Guidelines for using AI in the classroom:

- AI should be used to supplement, not replace, human interaction and
  instruction.
- Students should be made aware of the limitations of AI, and encouraged
  to question and critically evaluate the information provided by AI
  systems.
- AI should be used in a way that is inclusive and respectful of all
  students, regardless of their background or abilities.
- AI should be used to enhance the learning experience, not to create
  additional barriers or challenges for students.
- AI should be used to promote collaboration and teamwork among
  students.
- Students should be encouraged to use AI in a responsible and ethical
  manner.

##### Responsibilities of students:

- Students are responsible for using AI in a way that is consistent with
  this policy.
- Students should be familiar with the capabilities and limitations of
  the AI systems they are using in the classroom.
- Students should use AI in a responsible and ethical manner.
- Students should seek assistance from instructors if they have any
  concerns or issues regarding the use of AI in the classroom.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that the use of AI in the
classroom is a positive and inclusive experience for all students. We
believe that AI can be a powerful tool for enhancing the learning
experience, but it is important to approach it with a positive attitude
and a respect for its capabilities and limitations. Together, we can
create a classroom environment that is both engaging and respectful of
all students.
