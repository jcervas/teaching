### Course Description:

Democracy in the United States is looking a bit rickety. A notable
portion of the American populace, often long before any ballots are
cast, holds a persistent belief that the electoral process is flawed or
‘rigged’. This sentiment is exacerbated by instances where the
majority’s preferences seem to be ignored or sidelined. In recent years,
there have been notable shifts in the judiciary, with long-established
legal precedents being overturned, often contrary to widespread public
opinion. Additionally, the progress achieved in the realm of voting
rights since the 1960s is facing setbacks in numerous states. A
particularly alarming indication of the vulnerability of our democratic
institutions occurred three years ago with the then-president’s
unconstitutional attempts to maintain power, culminating in a violent
insurrection against the U.S. government.

This course will provide an in-depth exploration of the essential
aspects of representation and voting rights, concentrating on ensuring
election integrity, achieving fair redistricting, and promoting a just
democracy. We will examine the historical trajectory of voting rights in
the U.S., confront contemporary challenges to our democratic processes,
and consider a range of reforms to strengthen democratic representation
in our society. Additionally, we will discuss how political polarization
is impacting even non-political institutions. An example of this is the
recent campaign against the former president of Harvard, who was both
the university’s first Black president and second female president. Her
academic background in political science, with a focus overlapping this
course’s content, adds relevance to this discussion.

The course is structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of
these issues, encouraging critical analysis and informed debate about
the state and future of democracy in the United States. The course will
combine lectures with interactive discussions, case studies, guest
speakers, and project-based learning. Students will engage in critical
analysis of current events, participate in simulations, and conduct
research projects to propose solutions for enhancing democratic
representation.

### Key Topics:

- **Historical Overview of Voting Rights**: Tracing the development of
  voting rights from the founding of the United States to the present
  day, with a focus on key legislation and court cases.
- **Election Systems and Their Impact**: Analysis of different electoral
  systems and their effects on political representation and voter
  engagement.
- **Redistricting and Gerrymandering**: Exploring the process of
  redistricting, its impact on political representation, and the ongoing
  debate over gerrymandering.
- **Challenges to Equitable Democracy**: Investigating contemporary
  challenges such as voter suppression, electoral integrity, and
  political polarization.
- **Reform and the Future of Democracy**: Discussing potential reforms
  like ranked-choice voting, redistricting commissions, and campaign
  finance reform, and their potential to create a more equitable
  democratic system.

### Prerequisite Knowledge:

None required. This course will begin with the most basic understanding
of democratic processes and attempt to “build the puzzle” of the complex
systems that make up our representative democracy. Redistricting will be
done on laptop computer running Dave’s Redistricting App. Computer
programming is optional but encouraged for those with `Python` or `R`
skills.

### Credits:

This course is suitable for both undergraduate \[9 units\] and graduate
students \[12 units\].

### Course Relevance:

The current state of democracy in the United States presents critical
issues, particularly in how public opinion translates into governmental
actions and outcomes. This course is crafted to delve deeply into the
concept of representation. Though we will discuss the history of voting
rights in the US, we will use it to contextualize the current state of
American democracy.

Our study places significant emphasis on redistricting, which involves
the redrawing of legislative and congressional district boundaries. Data
from Google Trends indicates that public interest in redistricting
reached its zenith in February 2022, and it continues to be a topic of
considerable importance and attention. We will explore a range of
boundary-drawing techniques aimed at achieving equitable representation
and reflecting the diversity of communities. An important part of our
discussion will focus on how district boundaries might be manipulated,
potentially undermining minority representation or unduly entrenching a
political party’s dominance, which may not align with the electorate’s
preferences. Beyond theoretical knowledge, this course involves
practical engagement in redistricting through the use of geographic
information systems software, contributing meaningfully to the
redistricting processes of state and local governments. To accommodate
various interests, the course includes specialized tracks in computer
science, mathematics, law, and geography, each focusing on different
aspects of redistricting.

Our journey will also encompass an exploration of the ‘one person, one
vote’ principle, a comprehensive understanding of the US Census and its
implications, an analysis of the Electoral College’s influence in
elections, and an examination of federalism in the context of vertical
representation, as well as the system of checks and balances integral to
horizontal representation. We will pay close attention to the evolution
and present challenges of the right to vote, highlighting key debates
and issues in contemporary voting rights.

This course fundamentally addresses how representation in government
mirrors public opinion and electoral results, extending to broader
societal sentiments. Although focusing mainly on the United States, we
will draw comparative insights from democratic systems in other
countries. Recent trends towards anti-majoritarian outcomes in the U.S.,
raising concerns about the electoral link, will be a topic of analysis.

### Summary:

Throughout this course, we will delve into the multifaceted concept of
representation, focusing on three key areas: 1) the intricacies of
voting rights, 2) the dynamics of electoral democracy and
representation, and 3) the technicalities of formal representation,
particularly redistricting. While the primary lens of our study will be
the American political system, the universality of democracy and
representation means that we may also draw valuable insights from other
global systems.

Our exploration will begin with an in-depth look at the theoretical
foundations of representation, framed within the context of democratic
norms and the legal and constitutional frameworks that define U.S.
institutions. A significant portion of the course will be dedicated to a
historical review of voting rights in America, tracing their evolution
and current state.

A crucial aspect of legislative elections in the U.S. is their
organization in single-member districts, necessitating the redrawing of
district boundaries every ten years. We will allocate several weeks to
thoroughly understand this redistricting process. This will not only
include learning how to create legally compliant electoral maps but also
exploring the potential for and implications of manipulated districting,
which can yield partisan or racial advantages. Additionally, we will
develop the skills to identify and assess features in redistricting
plans that may indicate such biases.

### Learning Objectives:

Over the course of this class, students will acquire a comprehensive
understanding of the political landscape, particularly in the context of
voting and elections, through the lenses of law, political science,
mathematics, sociology, and computer science. They will develop the
ability to critically assess various electoral systems, recognizing
their respective strengths and weaknesses in terms of representation and
policy outcomes. A key focus will be on the correlation between voting
rights and the lived experiences and opportunities of different groups.
This exploration will extend to understanding the significance of voting
rights across diverse communities, how these variations shed light on
necessary improvements, and the impact of institutional design on
incentive structures, including the potential for institutional biases
against minority groups under majority rule systems. Students will also
gain insights into how electoral system selection can address structural
discrimination against minority groups.

The curriculum includes a thorough study of the US Census and the
process of decennial reapportionment. Students will gain practical
skills in designing legally compliant political district maps and
analyze how the delineation of legislative districts can
disproportionately affect groups, particularly marginalized ones,
possibly leading to their under-representation. The course will cover
data analysis techniques, introducing advanced methodologies from
computer science and mathematics. Furthermore, students will devise
strategies to reduce inequalities in voting rights and foster a more
equitable society.

By the end of this course, students will be proficient in applying
methodologies from their own academic discipline to identify and rectify
shortcomings in voting systems, as well as in incorporating techniques
from other disciplines to enhance democratic problem-solving approaches.
