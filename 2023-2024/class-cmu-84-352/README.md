## Description/Objective:

Democracy in the United States is looking a bit rickety. Decades of
progress in voting rights are countered by recent efforts to weaken the
connection between popular opinion and representational outcomes. This
course will address a board set of topics relating to representation,
including redistricting, the process of redrawing legislative and
congressional lines, which every state will do in 2021. Redistricting
can remedy a distorted Census count - or make its effects tenfold worse.
We will address how lines can be drawn to enhance fairness and the
representation of diverse communities. We will also spend time on the
concept of ‘one person, one vote’, the Electoral College, the structure
of federalism (vertical representation) and checks and balances in the
branches of government (horizonal representation). Special attention
will be given to access to the franchise, both in the historical context
modern voting rights.

## Key Topics:

The electoral connection, the Voting Rights Act, formal, substantive,
descriptive, and symbolic representation, gerrymandering, ‘One person,
one vote’, policy congruence
