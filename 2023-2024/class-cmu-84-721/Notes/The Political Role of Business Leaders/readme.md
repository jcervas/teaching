**Article Citation:** Hersh, Eitan. 2023. “The Political Role of Business Leaders.” Annual Review of Political Science 26(1): 97–115. https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051921-102505



## Part 1: Introduction

### The Two Narratives
- **First Narrative**: Economic elites have too much influence, undermining democracy.
- **Second Narrative**: Economic elites can contribute positively to governance.

### Goal of the Article
- Reveal how each narrative stands up to scholarly scrutiny and public opinion.

## Part 2: Dominance of Economic Elites

### Evidence Supporting the Narrative
1. Gilens & Page (2014)
   - Data suggest the affluent have disproportionate influence.
2. Multiple Surveys
   - Public largely views business influence as negative.

### Counterpoints
- Economic elites are not monolithic.
- Policy influence is complex and varies across sectors.

## Part 3: The Under-Engagement of Business Elites

### Alternative Viewpoints
1. Mizruchi (2013)
   - Business leaders are less politically active than assumed.
2. Evidence from Surveys
   - Economic elites show reformist tendencies (Porter et al. 2019).

### Policy Influence by Economic Elites
- Business leaders who do engage in politics are not always successful (Smith 2018).

## Part 4: Business Elites Should—and Can—Lead Again

### Problem Areas
1. Particularism
   - Public and elites both disapprove (Hersh & Schaffner 2017).
2. Elitism and Conservatism
   - Public is not largely concerned; they even approve of corporate leadership (Graham & Svolik 2020).

### Benefits of Corporate Political Leadership
- Aligned with public policy that is beneficial for the economy.
- More favorable public perception compared to politicians.

### Risks and Challenges
- Historical cases where elites acted against public interest.
- Need for responsible leadership, not domination.

### Conclusions
- Second narrative should not be dismissed.
- Importance of understanding why business leaders have disengaged from politics.
