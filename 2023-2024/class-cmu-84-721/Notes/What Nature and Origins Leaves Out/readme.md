## Summary of "_WHAT NATURE AND ORIGINS LEAVES OUT_"

Zaller, John. 2012. “WHAT NATURE AND ORIGINS LEAVES OUT.” Critical Review 24(4): 569–642. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08913811.2012.807648 (Accessed October 18, 2022).


The text is an in-depth discussion of the complexities and limitations of current theories regarding public opinion, policy preferences, and the democratic system. The overarching argument seems to be that the role of policy preferences in shaping political outcomes may be overemphasized. Instead, the text argues that non-policy-based attitudes, like economic sentiments or group affiliations, often play a more decisive role.

### Summary of Section on Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion

The seminal work, "The Nature and Origins of Mass Opinion," initially offered a holistic model called the Receive-Accept-Sample (RAS) model, which synthesized earlier research into a coherent theory explaining the dynamics of public opinion. Over the years, the Big Picture provided by the book has started to fray, requiring a critical reevaluation.

1. **Core RAS Model**: Despite criticism, the core RAS model remains robust but needs to be applied carefully. 
2. **Elite Influence**: The book places too much emphasis on the role of elites, particularly science-minded elites, in shaping public opinion. New research suggests a broader range of actors, including interest groups and politicians, are more impactful.
3. **Parable of Purple Land**: Once a cornerstone example, the "Parable of Purple Land" no longer holds up, and newer research challenges its relevance.
4. **Political Consequences**: A significant drawback is questioning the political impact of opinions shaped by elites. Are they substantive or mere lip service?
5. **Omissions**: The book neglects areas of public opinion less influenced by ideology or elite, such as latent opinions, group identities, and narrower concerns like single issues.

Overall, the text still holds merit but needs significant updates and revisions to integrate new scholarship and address its limitations.


### Key Points:

1. **Influence of Economic Conditions**: Public opinion on healthcare and other policies are heavily influenced by the economic situation. For example, the author argues that the passage of health reform was more a result of economic downturns rather than public attitudes toward healthcare itself.
   
2. **Ideologically Organized Preferences**: The text critiques Downs's median-voter theory, arguing that the evidence does not support the idea of ideologically organized policy preferences having a major influence on electoral outcomes.
  
3. **Nature-of-the-Times Voter**: The text suggests that voters are often not ideological medians but rather nature-of-the-times or group-interest voters. These voters may not exert pressure on parties to moderate their agendas, but rather can cause a shift in party alignments.
  
4. **Case of African Americans**: As an example, the text cites how the New Deal policies drew a significant number of Northern black voters into the Democratic Party, illustrating how pivotal voters can significantly alter the political landscape.
  
5. **Political Parties and Nominating Coalitions**: The text suggests that parties primarily respond to their coalition sponsors rather than the broader public opinion. They are, however, responsive to potentially pivotal voters who might switch sides.

6. **Role of Ideology**: The text also questions the role of ideology in political activism, suggesting that more narrow goals might often be more influential. 
  
7. **Challenges for Scholars**: Finally, the author suggests that scholars should potentially move away from normative ideals when studying political behavior and take an empiricist stance.

In conclusion, the text offers a complex view of the role of public opinion and policy preferences in democratic systems, arguing for a more nuanced understanding that incorporates economic conditions, group interests, and other non-policy-based factors.
