# AI Debate Simulation: A Flexible Framework

## Important Note on Using These Guidelines
These instructions provide a suggested framework and helpful starting points - they are not rigid requirements. Feel free to adapt and modify these approaches based on your debate style, topic, and how the conversation naturally develops. The goal is to engage in meaningful discourse that deepens understanding of political polarization, not to follow a strict formula.

## Initial Setup Prompts
The following prompts are examples of how you might begin your debate. Feel free to modify these or create your own approach that better suits your topic and style:

### Prompt Option 1 - Neutral Start
```
I would like to engage in a structured debate about [TOPIC]. Please take a position opposite to mine. I will begin by stating my position, and then you should respond with a counter-argument. Please focus on evidence-based reasoning and maintain a respectful tone throughout our exchange.
```

### Prompt Option 2 - Multiple Perspectives
```
I want to explore different perspectives on [TOPIC]. After I present my initial position, please respond by challenging my viewpoint with evidence-based arguments. In this debate, please prioritize citing specific examples and data when possible.
```

### Prompt Option 3 - Solution-Focused
```
I would like to debate [TOPIC], focusing on potential solutions. After I present my position, please challenge my views constructively while suggesting alternative approaches. Let's aim to explore both the challenges and possible compromises.
```

## Debate Structure
While these guidelines suggest a structure, your debate may naturally take a different form. What matters most is that you:
- Engage substantively with the topic
- Maintain a reasonable back-and-forth exchange
- Cover the topic thoroughly
- Demonstrate critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning

### Suggested Parameters
- Minimum: 4 complete exchanges (8 total responses, 4 from each participant)
- Maximum: 6 complete exchanges (12 total responses, 6 from each participant)
- Target time: 30-45 minutes
- Each response should be substantive (approximately 250-300 words)

### Format for Each Response
Here's one possible way to structure your responses, but feel free to develop your own approach as long as you're making clear, well-supported arguments:
```
In response to your point about [summarize previous argument], I argue that [your position] because:

1. [First piece of evidence or reasoning]
2. [Second piece of evidence or reasoning]
3. [Third piece of evidence or reasoning]

Furthermore, I would challenge your assertion that [address specific point] because [counter-argument].
```

## Concluding the Debate
The debate should conclude when ONE of the following occurs:
1. You complete at least 4 exchanges and have reached a natural conclusion point
2. You've reached 6 exchanges (maximum limit)
3. 45 minutes have elapsed
4. You've explored all major aspects of your topic and identified potential areas of compromise

### Final Exchange Prompt
When ready to conclude, you might use something like this:
```
As we conclude this debate, I would like to summarize the key points we've discussed and identify any areas of potential compromise. From our exchange, the main areas of disagreement appear to be [list points], while we found common ground on [list points]. Would you agree with this assessment, and could you help identify any potential solutions that address both perspectives?
```

## Tips for Maintaining Productive Dialogue
- If the AI response becomes repetitive, use: "Let's explore a different aspect of this issue, specifically..."
- If you need more specific evidence, use: "Could you provide specific examples or data to support that point?"
- If the discussion strays off-topic, use: "Let's return our focus to the core issue of..."
- If you want to explore a compromise, use: "What middle-ground solutions might address both perspectives on..."

## Troubleshooting
If the AI:
- Becomes too agreeable: "Please maintain your opposing position and challenge my arguments more directly."
- Strays from evidence: "Let's focus on verifiable evidence and specific examples in our discussion."
- Takes your position: "Please argue from the opposing viewpoint to ensure a balanced debate."

## Submission Requirements

### Documentation of Debate
Choose ONE of the following methods to submit your debate:

1. **Copy-Paste Method**
   - Copy the entire debate exchange, including your prompts and all AI responses

2. **Share Link Method** (if available in your version of Microsoft Co-pilot)
   - Generate a shareable link to your debate

### Canvas Submission Process
1. Log into Canvas
2. Navigate to our course page
3. Select the "Assignments" tab
4. Find "AI Debate Simulation Assignment"
5. Upload your document or paste your link in the submission text box
6. Complete the submission by clicking "Submit Assignment"

### Academic Integrity Guidelines

#### Independent Work Requirements
- This is an individual assignment that must be completed independently
- While you may discuss the assignment parameters and topic selection with classmates, your debate must be conducted individually
- Each student must generate their own unique debate exchange
- Sharing debate transcripts or collaborating during the debate is allowed

#### Acceptable Collaboration
You MAY:
- Discuss topic selection with classmates
- Share research sources before the debate
- Seek technical support for using the AI platform
- Ask the professor for clarification on assignment requirements

You may NOT:
- Conduct debates together
- Share or copy debate transcripts
- Use another student's debate as a template
- Submit the same or similar exchanges as another student

### Technical Tips
- Save your debate transcript periodically during the exchange
- Take screenshots as backup if using the link method
- Test your shareable link before submitting
- Keep a backup copy of your submission

### Keys to Success
Remember that the most important aspects of this assignment are:
- Engaging deeply with your chosen topic
- Demonstrating critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning
- Exploring multiple perspectives
- Showing understanding of political polarization dynamics
- Practicing constructive political discourse

How you achieve these goals may vary from the suggested framework in these guidelines. Trust your instincts and let the conversation develop naturally while keeping the core learning objectives in mind.
