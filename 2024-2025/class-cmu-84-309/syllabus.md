## Course Description

“American Political Divides and Great Debates” dives into the heart of
U.S. political polarization, examining its causes, effects, and the
systemic inequalities it perpetuates. Engaging with topics like voting
rights, healthcare, and racial and economic disparities through critical
discussions and debates, this course hones critical thinking, public
speaking, and empathy. Ideal for those interested in political science,
law, or social justice, it offers deep insights into America’s political
landscape and strategies for fostering justice and equity at all
societal levels.

The course targets systematic and structural inequalities related to
political polarization, focusing on past and present issues such as
voting rights, access to healthcare, racial discrimination,
environmental inequalities, and economic disparity. It examines how
these inequalities influence public policy and political discourse,
aiming to uncover their roots and impacts on society. Through this
analysis, the course encourages a deeper understanding of the
complexities surrounding justice and injustice in the American political
landscape.

This course is ideal for students with interests in political science,
history, law, social justice, and those looking to gain a deeper
understanding of the complex political landscape of the United States
and its implications for justice and injustice in society.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students will have a deepened understanding of
the complex forces driving political polarization. They will be equipped

## Grading

Your grade will mostly reflect your participation in this course. This
course is designed to be interactive. That is, you involvement in
discussions, participation in debates, and of course having read the
material are critical to your success.

Class attendance and participation are important parts of the learning
in this course. To account for this, a portion of the final grade is
based on your regular attendance and active participation (see grading
section). That said, I also recognize that students may need to miss
class for a variety of reasons (religious observance, job interview,
university-sanctioned event, or illness). For that reason, all students
are permitted two class absences without any impact on the final grade.
When you must miss class, please notify me (at least 24 hours in advance
except for illness/emergency), so that we can discuss alternative
arrangements for catching up on class and associated work. If you
encounter extenuating circumstances and must miss more than two classes,
please come and discuss the issue with me; I would like to find a way to
support you.

Students are expected and encouraged to meet all deadlines for
assignments. If you are unable to complete the assignment work by the
due date, reach out in advance to make alternative arrangements. I
typically will not penalize you for turning in your assignment late, so
long as it does not hinder completion of other’s work (ie, group
projects).

## Assessment

The course grade will be a weighted average of the following components:

| Category                         | Percent of Final Grade |
|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Participation and Engagement** | 10%                    |
| **Reflective Statements**        | 10%                    |
| **Critical Reading Responses**   | 20%                    |
| **Op-ed w/ Peer Review**         |                        |
| Peer Review                      | 10%                    |
| Final Paper                      | 10%                    |
| **AI-Powered Debate Simulation** | 10%                    |
| **Debate Participation**         | 10%                    |
| **Group Project**                | 20%                    |

**Reflective Statements**: Students critically reflect on course
readings and discussions, articulating their understanding of the issues
and their personal perspectives on justice and injustice. These should
include elements of self-evaluation. Due on Sundays. Graded as
complete/not-complete. (10 total, one to two paragraphs)

**AI-Powered Debate Simulation**: Utilize Microsoft Co-Pilot to simulate
debate scenarios where students can practice their debating skills. The
AI will present arguments on various sides of an issue related to the
course content. Students will respond in real-time, allowing them to
refine their argumentation, critical thinking, and public speaking
skills. This assessment will be graded on the complexity of their
arguments, the ability to counter AI propositions, and the use of
evidence-based reasoning to support their stance. (Five times this
semester.)

**Critical Reading Responses**: Write a 3-5 single-spaced page analysis
of two books you will read this semester. A reading list is provided in
this syllabus. Your analysis should demonstrate a deep comprehension of
the material and engage critically with the complex ideas presented. In
your response, focus on evaluating the author’s arguments, identifying
underlying assumptions, and discussing the broader implications of the
ideas. Be sure to use evidence from the text to support your analysis.
(First book due October 13, 11:59p; Second book due December 1, 11:59p)

**Op-ed w/ peer-review**: Drawing on a topic related to this course, or
something political from your own life or experience, write an op-ed
that could be published in a newspaper or blog. (First Draft due Sept
22, 11:59p, final draft due Sept 29, 11:59p, peer review due by Sept 25,
11:59p)

**Group Project**: You will work in groups to research and present on a
specific topic related to American political divides. Your project
should focus on identifying and analyzing key issues that contribute to
political polarization in the United States. As a group, you will
prepare a presentation that demonstrates your collective research
findings, understanding of the topic, and ability to present diverse
perspectives. You will also submit an individual reflection related to
your work as a team. (Twice during the semester.)

**Debate Participation**: This component assesses students’ involvement
in live debates and discussions conducted during class.

You will be assigned one of the following roles:

- Affirmative Initial Debater: Present the main arguments in favor of
  the proposal.  
- Affirmative Rebuttal: Respond to the opposing side’s arguments,
  defending your position and challenging their points.  
- Against Initial Debater: Present the main arguments against the
  proposal.  
- Against Rebuttal: Respond to the affirmative side’s arguments,
  defending your position and challenging their points.

You will be graded on a completion basis (complete/incomplete), and to
be completed you will need to demonstrate that you prepared in advanced.

**Participation and Engagement**: This component evaluates the degree to
which students actively contribute to the course through various forms
of engagement. This includes, but is not limited to:

- *Attendance*: Regular attendance is expected. Students may miss up to
  two classes and receive full marks for attendance.
- *Class Participation*: Active involvement in class discussions is
  crucial. Students should demonstrate thoughtful contributions, engage
  with their peers’ ideas, and ask insightful questions related to
  course material.
- *Preparation*: Students are expected to come prepared for each class,
  having completed the required readings and assignments. This
  preparation will be assessed through in-class discussions and the
  quality of participation.
- *Engagement in Course Activities*: Participation in additional
  course-related activities, such as workshops, guest lectures, or
  online discussions, will also be considered.
- *Professionalism and Respect*: Demonstrating respect for classmates’
  viewpoints and maintaining a professional demeanor in all interactions
  is important. This includes adhering to classroom etiquette and
  providing constructive feedback to peers.

## Student Privacy in Class Discussions

This course will challenge you to think deeply about difficult and
potentially provocative questions. You should be prepared to encounter
material that may be unsettling or even offensive. If you’re not
comfortable with the possibility of being offended, you might want to
reconsider enrolling. However, if you choose to participate and find
yourself disagreeing with something said by a classmate, or me, or with
content from the readings, I encourage you to engage in thoughtful
debate and present your own perspective. Simply disliking a viewpoint
doesn’t invalidate it. My hope is that, regardless of how strongly we
disagree or how passionately we advocate for our beliefs, we will always
maintain respect and treat each other with dignity as we share and
defend our ideas.

In this course, we value the open exchange of ideas and respect the
privacy of all students. To create a safe and supportive learning
environment, the following guidelines regarding student privacy in class
discussions will be strictly observed:

1.  **Confidentiality**: Any personal information, opinions, or
    experiences shared by students during class discussions, whether
    in-person or online, are to be treated as confidential. Students are
    prohibited from sharing or discussing this information outside of
    class without explicit permission from the individuals involved.

2.  **Respectful Communication**: Students are encouraged to express
    their thoughts and ideas freely while remaining respectful of
    others’ privacy. Avoid sharing details about other students’
    contributions, identities, or personal circumstances outside the
    classroom setting.

3.  **Recording and Sharing**: Recording of class discussions, whether
    audio, video, or text-based, is strictly prohibited. Anyone caught
    making an unauthorized recording will automatically fail the
    course—regardless of any accommodations they may have been granted.

4.  **Online Discussions**: For online forums and discussions, similar
    privacy standards apply. Students should be mindful of the public or
    semi-public nature of online platforms and refrain from sharing
    sensitive or personally identifiable information.

5.  **Consequences for Breach of Privacy**: Violations of this privacy
    policy may result in disciplinary action, which could include
    removal from the course, a formal reprimand, or other consequences
    as determined by the university’s code of conduct.

6.  **Principle of Charity**: When engaging in discussions, apply the
    principle of charity. This means interpreting others’ arguments in
    the most reasonable and positive way before criticizing them. Assume
    that others are making sincere attempts to contribute meaningfully,
    and engage with their strongest points, not just the easiest to
    refute.

7.  **Space for Additional Context**: Acknowledge that opinions shared
    in discussions may be based on limited information or experiences.
    If a classmate’s perspective seems unclear or incomplete, allow them
    the opportunity to provide additional context. Encourage questions
    that seek to understand rather than dismiss others’ views.

By participating in this course, you agree to uphold these privacy
standards and contribute to a respectful, inclusive, and secure learning
environment for all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DEI&B - Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, & Belonging

Throughout this course, we will engage with several key themes that
intersect and build upon one another to deepen our understanding of the
complex social and political landscape in the United States.

1.  Analyzing Diverse Perspectives and Political Divides

One of the primary themes we will explore is the diverse perspectives
and experiences of various marginalized groups within the U.S. We will
critically analyze how these perspectives have contributed to a growing
political divide, focusing on the ways in which the lived experiences of
marginalized communities differ from those of majority groups. This
exploration is essential for understanding the roots of political
polarization and for developing strategies to bridge these divides.

2.  The Significance of Diverse Viewpoints in Justice and Injustice

We will delve into the importance of recognizing and valuing the diverse
viewpoints of marginalized communities. These perspectives often bring
to light issues of justice and injustice that are otherwise overlooked
or misunderstood by majority groups. By examining these differences, we
aim to foster a deeper understanding of how justice is perceived and
enacted in society, and how equitable solutions can be pursued in
addressing political and social challenges.

3.  The Role of Systems and Institutions in Perpetuating Inequality

Another critical theme is the examination of how systems and
institutions in the U.S. have historically perpetuated privilege and
maintained power dynamics that contribute to ongoing inequality. We will
explore how these structures shape the experiences of different groups,
influence political issues, and reinforce disparities in access to
resources, opportunities, and rights. Understanding these systemic
forces is key to addressing the root causes of injustice.

4.  Ethical Obligations to Address Inequality

Throughout the semester, we will reflect on the individual and
collective ethical obligations to address inequalities. This includes
considering how we can support marginalized voices, advocate for
justice, and work towards dismantling oppressive systems. These
reflections will challenge us to think critically about our roles in
society and the impact of our actions on the broader pursuit of equity
and justice.

*These overarching themes will be woven into our discussions, readings,
and assignments, guiding us as we critically engage with the material
and strive to understand the complexities of American society. By the
end of the semester, students will have developed a nuanced perspective
on the intersection of identity, power, and politics, and will be
equipped to contribute to meaningful change in their communities.*

### Diversity Statement

I am committed to a diversity of representation in readings for this
course. If you feel like there is a voice that I have missed, please
make a suggestion so I can improve the syllabus and this course for both
this semester and future iterations.

**We must treat every individual with respect**. We are diverse in many
ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an
equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to
multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to
race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual
orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran
status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along
with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our
students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work
to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity
fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.
We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work,
inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a
campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive
environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether
intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming
environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the
university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or
hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and
support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has
passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following
resources:

**Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion**:
**<csdi@andrew.cmu.edu>**, (412) 268-2150

**Ethics Reporting Hotline**. Students, faculty, and staff can
anonymously file a report by calling 844-587-0793 or visiting
cmu.ethicspoint.com. All reports will be documented and deliberated to
determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of
incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to
transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the
Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your
accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I
will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as
appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would
benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office
of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
**<access@andrew.cmu.edu>**.

### Student well-being

The last few years have been challenging. We are all under a lot of
stress and uncertainty at this time. I encourage you to find ways to
move regularly, eat well, and reach out to your support system or me
**<cervas@cmu.edu>** if you need to. We can all benefit from support in
times of stress, and this semester is no exception.

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can
interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased
anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or
lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to
participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and
treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at: <http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/>.
Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological
Services: 412-268-2922.
