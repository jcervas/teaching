| **Complexity of Arguments**             | Arguments are highly sophisticated, demonstrating deep understanding and original thought. Multiple perspectives are considered, and the reasoning is nuanced and well-developed. | Arguments are well-constructed and show a good understanding of the issue. Some complexity and multiple perspectives are present. | Arguments are somewhat simplistic but relevant. Limited complexity, and perspectives are not fully explored. | Arguments lack depth and are overly simplistic or superficial, demonstrating minimal understanding of the issue. | /4        |
| **Countering AI Propositions**          | Effectively counters the AI's arguments with strong rebuttals, showing insight and creativity. Anticipates AI's points and preemptively addresses them. | Counters AI's arguments with solid rebuttals. Demonstrates good understanding and the ability to address most points effectively. | Some counterarguments are provided, but they may be less convincing or fail to address key points effectively. | Struggles to counter the AI's arguments, offering weak or irrelevant rebuttals. Little to no anticipation of AI's points. | /4        |
| **Use of Evidence-Based Reasoning**     | Integrates a wide range of high-quality, relevant evidence to support arguments. Clearly explains how the evidence supports the stance. | Uses relevant evidence to support most arguments. The connection between evidence and the argument is generally clear. | Some evidence is used, but it may be limited in scope or relevance. The connection to the argument may be weak or unclear. | Little to no evidence is provided, or the evidence used is irrelevant or inaccurate. Arguments are mostly unsupported. | /4        |
| **Clarity and Organization**            | Arguments are presented in a clear, logical, and well-organized manner. Transitions are smooth, and the overall flow enhances the argument's persuasiveness. | Arguments are clear and generally well-organized. Some transitions may be awkward, but the overall flow is coherent. | Arguments are somewhat clear but may be disorganized or difficult to follow. Transitions may be abrupt or missing. | Arguments are unclear, disorganized, or difficult to follow. The lack of structure significantly detracts from the argument's effectiveness. | /4        |
| **Responsiveness and Adaptability**     | Demonstrates exceptional adaptability by responding to AI-generated challenges with agility and creativity. Adjusts arguments in real-time effectively. | Shows good adaptability, responding to AI challenges with reasonable effectiveness and making some adjustments as needed. | Shows limited adaptability, with responses that may be slow or less effective. Struggles to adjust arguments in real-time. | Lacks adaptability, struggling to respond to AI challenges and failing to adjust arguments. Responses are rigid or repetitive. | /4        |
