# Assignment: Analyzing Patterns in Early Voting and Voter Data Across States

### Objective:
Students will evaluate patterns in early voting and the number of people, voters, and citizen voters across different states. They will assess how these factors might affect voter turnout and convenience in the voting process.

### Instructions:

You have been provided with state-level data on:
1. The availability and rules regarding early voting.
2. The total population of each state.
3. The number of registered voters in each state.
4. The number of citizens eligible to vote in each state.
5. Demographic data in each state.
6. Absentee requirement by state.
7. The number of days of early voting in each state.

Using this data, complete the following tasks:

---

### Task 1: Add data about early voting
1. **Early Voting**: Navigate to https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/early-in-person-voting. Using the map, create a new variable called `Voting-Option` that takes one of four values.

---

### Task 2: Identify States with the Most and Least Convenient Voting Rules
1. **Early Voting Availability**: Create a variable categorizing states into three groups based on their early voting rules:
   - States with **no-excuse early voting** (where any voter can vote early without a specific reason).
   - States with **restricted early voting** (where early voting is allowed under specific conditions or with an excuse).
   - States with **no early voting**.

2. **Analysis**: Using the data in your new variables, and those from `Absentee-Voting-Policy`, 
   - which states provide the **most convenient** access to voting? Which provide the **least convenient**? 
   - Explain why you consider certain states to offer more or less convenience.

---

### Task 2: Evaluate the Impact of Early Voting on Voter Turnout Potential
1. **Population vs. Voters**: Calculate the percentage of voters compared to the total population. 
   
2. **Citizen Voter Comparison**: Calculate the percentage of voters out of the total **citizen voter** population (those eligible to vote).
   
3. **Analysis**:
   - Compare the percentage of voters in states with **no-excuse early voting** to those with **no early voting**. Does there appear to be a relationship between early voting rules and registration levels?
   - Hypothesize how early voting rules could impact voter turnout in a state.

---

### Task 3: Identify Patterns in Voter Convenience and Demographics
1. **State Comparison**: Analyze the different factors that might affect the accessibility of voting for different populations.
   
2. **Conclusion**:
   - How do state-level voting laws potentially affect voter participation? 
   - Provide examples from your analysis to explain any patterns or exceptions you observe.

---

### Deliverables:
- Submit your answers in a written document (1-2 pages).
- Include your tables and calculations from Task 1 and Task 2.
- Provide clear explanations for your conclusions in Task 3.
