### Short Description:

This course offers a comprehensive exploration of democracy through a
data-driven lens, revealing the complex dynamics that shape our
political system. By analyzing quantitative information, students will
gain critical insights into the principles and practices that underlie
democratic institutions.

### Course Description:

This course is designed with the idea that our Democracy can best be
understood with data. “Democracy’s Data: Analytics and Insights into
American Elections” offers a unique blend of political science and data
analytics, focusing on the American electoral process with a special
emphasis on contemporary elections. This course bridges historical
electoral outcomes with current political events, highlighting how
understanding past elections is key to interpreting the dynamics of
present and future elections. This course recognizes a common
observation: people often view the next election as the most
consequential. However, history tells us that the impact of elections
can be profound and long-lasting. From the pivotal election of 1876,
which ended Reconstruction and reshaped the country for a century, to
the razor-thin margins in the 1960 Kennedy election and the 2000
Bush-Gore contest, American politics have been deeply influenced by
electoral outcomes.

Throughout the semester, students will delve into data analytics’
foundational concepts, focusing on data collection, statistical
analysis, and interpretation. These techniques are applied to
contemporary election trends, voter behavior, and political campaigning.
The course uses historical elections as case studies to illustrate how
past events and trends can shed light on current electoral phenomena.

The curriculum emphasizes the significance of historical context in
shaping our understanding of today’s elections. Students will explore
how factors such as changing voter demographics, technological
advancements in campaigning, and shifts in political ideologies have
evolved over time and what they mean for current and future electoral
strategies and outcomes.

Hands-on projects with real electoral data sets will enable students to
apply their analytical skills to contemporary election scenarios. This
approach enhances their ability to discern patterns and draw meaningful
conclusions about modern political campaigns and voter behavior.

### Course Goals

By the end of the course, students will be able to frame questions
related to American elections, such as how do candidates emerge, why do
some candidates succeed while others fail, when do elections
fundamentally change the course of history, and who votes and why?
Students will be able to utilize diverse electoral data sources to
analyze trends and patterns in American electoral behavior and outcomes.
Using that data, students will be able to make connections between and
across elections across the last several decades to explain how they
have led to recent electoral outcomes. Students will be asked to reflect
critically on personal perspectives regarding American elections in
light of historical, cultural, and political contexts.

### **Assignments**

1.  **Reflective Diary Entries:**  
    Each week, you will write a brief reflection on current events,
    particularly those related to topics discussed in class. These
    essays should be concise, typically one to two paragraphs. They will
    be private to you and the instructor. They will be graded on a
    completion basis (complete/incomplete). You are required to submit
    essays for 12 out of the 14 weeks.

2.  **Data Contributions:**  
    For each class, you must submit one piece of relevant data on the
    Canvas discussion board. This data should be pertinent to the
    upcoming class discussion and reflect current events. You can access
    free articles and archives from the New York Times and other major
    newspapers using your `cmu.edu` email. You may be called on randomly
    to share your data nugget. Discussion board will be open to the
    class. They will be graded on a completion basis
    (complete/incomplete).

    > **Example:**  
    > *Voter Turnout*: “About two-thirds (66%) of the voting-eligible
    > population turned out for the 2020 presidential election” [**Pew
    > Research
    > Center**](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/07/12/voter-turnout-2018-2022/).

    Submissions will be graded as complete/incomplete. You must complete
    20 submissions to receive full credit.

3.  **Historical Election Case Studies:**  
    You will analyze two specific historical elections, focusing on
    aspects such as campaign strategies, media impact, voter behavior,
    or the role of money in politics. Your case study should include a
    detailed report (3-5 pages, single-spaced) and a class presentation.
    The collected case studies will contribute to the creation of an
    “Atlas of American Presidential Elections, 1868-2024,” which we will
    collaboratively design in class and prepare for public release.

4.  **Data Problem Sets:**  
    Create compelling data visualizations (charts, graphs, interactive
    maps) that illustrate an aspect of the electoral process. These will
    often cover multiple time periods to establish a time series,
    focusing on themes like demographic shifts, geographic voting
    patterns, or changes in political alignment over time. These will
    typically be done in-class and are not scheduled in advance. You
    will be permitted to complete the work in subsequent days after
    class. (Work individually or in teams of up to three persons.) They
    will be graded on a completion basis (complete/incomplete).

5.  **Data Analysis Projects:**  
    Select two topics from the class syllabus (e.g., voter turnout,
    demographic patterns, polling data). Collect relevant data for each
    topic and conduct a thorough analysis to uncover significant
    findings or patterns. Your analysis should include statistical
    evaluation, data visualization, and a detailed interpretation of
    your results. These can be extensions of the Data Visualization
    Projects. You are permitted to replicate the analysis from an
    academic paper with a research topic relevant to the course. You
    should provide a research question and any context, including from
    academic or non-academic literature, to situate your research. (Due
    October 13 and November 26. Reports should be 1-2 pages,
    single-spaced, excluding visualizations.)

6.  **Policy Proposals:**  
    Develop a policy proposal that addresses a specific issue in the
    electoral process, such as increasing voter turnout, ensuring
    election security, or improving poll accuracy. Your proposal should
    be supported by data and historical analysis. (Due December 5. 2-4
    single-spaced pages, not including visualizations).  
    You will be responsible for reading two of your peer’s work, and
    providing feedback. You will also provide a grade, which I will
    average. If you feel you deserve a different grade, I am happy to
    evaluate it before the end of the semester. However, I reserve the
    right to lower the grade as I see fit.

7.  **Attendance:**  
    Regular attendance is expected for each class. You may miss up to
    two classes without penalty and still receive full credit.

Class attendance and participation are important parts of the learning
in this course. To account for this, a portion of the final grade is
based on your regular attendance and active participation (see grading
section). That said, I also recognize that students may need to miss
class for a variety of reasons (religious observance, job interview,
university-sanctioned event, or illness). For that reason, all students
are permitted two class absences without any impact on the final grade.
When you must miss class, please notify me (at least 24 hours in advance
except for illness/emergency), so that we can discuss alternative
arrangements for catching up on class and associated work. If you
encounter extenuating circumstances and must miss more than two classes,
please come and discuss the issue with me; I would like to find a way to
support you.

Students are expected and encouraged to meet all deadlines for
assignments. If you are unable to complete the assignment work by the
due date, reach out in advance to make alternative arrangements. I
typically will not penalize you for turning in your assignment late, so
long as it does not hinder completion of other’s work (ie, group
projects).

The course grade will be a weighted average of the following components:

| Category                             | Percent of Final Grade |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Diary Entries**                    | 10%                    |
| **Data Contributions**               | 15%                    |
| **Historical Election Case Studies** | 20%                    |
| **Data Problem Sets**                | 10%                    |
| **Data Analysis Projects**           | 20%                    |
| **Policy Proposals**                 | 15%                    |
| **Attendance**                       | 10%                    |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Diversity Statement

I am committed to a diversity of representation in readings for this
course. If you feel like there is a voice that I have missed, please
make a suggestion so I can improve the syllabus and this course for both
this semester and future iterations.

**We must treat every individual with respect**. We are diverse in many
ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an
equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to
multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to
race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual
orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran
status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along
with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our
students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work
to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity
fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice.
We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work,
inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a
campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.

Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive
environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether
intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming
environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the
university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or
hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and
support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has
passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following
resources:

**Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion**:
**<csdi@andrew.cmu.edu>**, (412) 268-2150

**Ethics Reporting Hotline**. Students, faculty, and staff can
anonymously file a report by calling 844-587-0793 or visiting
cmu.ethicspoint.com. All reports will be documented and deliberated to
determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of
incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to
transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the
Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your
accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I
will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as
appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would
benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office
of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at
**<access@andrew.cmu.edu>**.

### Student well-being

The last few years have been challenging. We are all under a lot of
stress and uncertainty at this time. I encourage you to find ways to
move regularly, eat well, and reach out to your support system or me
**<cervas@cmu.edu>** if you need to. We can all benefit from support in
times of stress, and this semester is no exception.

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can
interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased
anxiety, substance use, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or
lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to
participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and
treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at: <http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/>.
Support is always available (24/7) from Counseling and Psychological
Services: 412-268-2922.
